# Changelog

All notable changes to the Water Agent Governance Framework (WAGF) will be
documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Per-agent-type model names**: `llm_params.model` in YAML overrides CLI `--model`
  for individual agent types, enabling heterogeneous LLM configurations
- **MemoryEngineRegistry**: Plugin registry for memory engines — register custom
  engines without modifying framework code
- **ExperimentBuilder.validate()**: Pre-build validation with actionable error messages
- **CognitiveCache**: Decision-reuse cache (SHA-256 hash of state+env+memory) that
  bypasses LLM calls when context is identical
- **Advanced Patterns Guide**: State hierarchy, two-way coupling, per-type LLM docs
- **Multi-Agent Setup Guide**: Full walkthrough for heterogeneous agent populations
- **YAML Configuration Reference**: Field-by-field reference for all YAML config files
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: 21+ error patterns with diagnosis steps
- **Customization Guide (English)**: Translated from Chinese with added recipes
- **Multi-agent simple example**: 7-agent experiment (regulator + farmers) bridging
  the quickstart-to-production gap
- **Framework Parameter Reference** in README: All parameters with valid ranges
- **Test infrastructure**: `tests/conftest.py` with shared fixtures, 29 core tests
  covering ExperimentRunner and CognitiveCache

### Fixed
- **SkillProposal mutation**: Removed direct mutation of `magnitude_pct` and
  `magnitude_fallback` on the original proposal object
- **Validation context key collision**: Added `__debug__`-only diagnostic warning
  when `agent_state` and `env_context` share key names
- **AgentTypeConfig cache staleness**: Added `clear_cache()` classmethod for test
  teardown; improved error messages with actionable tips

### Changed
- **memory_factory.py**: Refactored from 147-line if/elif chain to 53-line
  delegation to MemoryEngineRegistry (backward compatible)
- **YAML error messages**: Now include file path, tip text, and suggested fix

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Initial release of the Water Agent Governance Framework
- 7-layer architecture: LLM Interface, Governance, Execution, Memory,
  Reflection, Social, Utilities
- SkillBrokerEngine 6-stage pipeline (Context, LLM, Parse, Validate,
  Approve, Execute)
- Three governance profiles: strict, flexible, autonomous
- Identity rules (boolean state checks) and thinking rules (construct evaluation)
- Five memory engines: Window, Importance, Hierarchical, HumanCentric, Universal
- ExperimentBuilder fluent API
- Phase ordering for multi-agent simulations
- Social graph with observation and gossip channels
- InteractionHub for tiered context assembly
- Five quickstart tiers with progressive complexity
- Flood domain (Paper 3) and irrigation domain (Paper 2) examples

### Known Issues
- `PrioritySchemaProvider`, `NarrativeProvider`, `EnvironmentObservationProvider`,
  and `InsuranceInfoProvider` are defined but not actively used in current examples
- `HierarchicalMemoryEngine` and `ImportanceMemoryEngine` are deprecated in favor
  of `HumanCentricMemoryEngine`
- No CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Test collection errors in `tests/sdk/` due to import issues

    You currently {insurance_status_text} flood insurance.
    You {trust_insurance_text} the insurance company. You {trust_neighbors_text} your neighbors' judgment.

    Using the Protection Motivation Theory, evaluate your current situation by considering the following factors:

    - Perceived Vulnerability: How likely you think you are to be affected.
    - Response Efficacy: How effective you believe each action is.
    - Self-Efficacy: Your confidence in your ability to take that action.
    - Response Cost: The financial and emotional cost of the action.
    - Maladaptive Rewards: The benefit of doing nothing immediately.

    Now, choose one of the following actions:
    {options_text}

    Please respond using the exact format below. Do NOT include any markdown symbols:
    Threat Appraisal: [One sentence summary of how threatened you feel by any remaining flood risks.]
    Coping Appraisal: [One sentence summary of how well you think you can cope or act.]
    Final Decision: [Choose {valid_choices_text} only]

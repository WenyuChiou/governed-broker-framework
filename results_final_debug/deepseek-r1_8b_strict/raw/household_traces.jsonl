The user is a homeowner with a strong community attachment but hasn't elevated their home. They're considering flood protection options based on Protection Motivation Theory.\n\nLooking at their memory cards, we see most neighbors haven't elevated (0%) but many have relocated (96%). That suggests relocation might be the dominant coping strategy in this neighborhood. The user doesn't have flood insurance yet.\n\nFor Threat Appraisal, I need to assess how threatened the user feels. The high neighbor relocation rate indicates serious flood risk perception, but no elevation among neighbors suggests uncertainty about the best protection. The user's community attachment might make them more risk-averse than those who've relocated.\n\nFor Coping Appraisal, the user has low self-efficacy for elevation (expensive) and relocation (requires moving). Insurance seems more accessible but offers limited protection. Their trust in neighbors might mean they underestimate community risk but overestimate their neighbors' solutions.\n\nThe user probably wants to protect their home and community without breaking the bank. Since no flood has occurred yet, \"Do Nothing\" seems rational from a risk perspective, but the neighbor data suggests ongoing threat. They might be hoping for better solutions than available while keeping options open.\n\nConsidering all factors, the balanced approach would be to acknowledge the threat but opt for minimal action for now, while keeping flood insurance as a fallback. This aligns with their trust in neighbors' judgment and community attachment.\n</think>\nThreat Appraisal: Med because while most neighbors have relocated, the low elevation rate suggests uncertainty about the best protection, indicating a serious but somewhat ambiguous flood risk perception.\nCoping Appraisal: Low because elevation is expensive and relocation is disruptive, while insurance offers limited physical protection and the user feels uncertain about the best action.\nFinal Decision: 1", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "buy_insurance", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.buy_insurance"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": true}, "error": null}, "outcome": "RETRY_SUCCESS", "retry_count": 2, "agent_type": "household", "validated": false, "validation_issues": [{"validator": "AgentValidator:thinking_error", "rule_id": "coping_alignment", "errors": ["[Rule: coping_alignment] Logic Error: Low Coping but expensive action attempted."]}]}

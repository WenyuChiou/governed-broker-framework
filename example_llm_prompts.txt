--- Agent_2 | Year 1 (Elevated: False) ---

You are a homeowner in a city, with a strong attachment to your community. You have not elevated your home.
Your memory includes:
- Year 1: No flood occurred this year.
- Year 1: I observe 0% of my neighbors have elevated homes.
- Year 1: I observe 0% of my neighbors have relocated.

You currently have flood insurance.
You have slight doubts about the insurance company. You are skeptical of your neighbors' judgment.

Using the Protection Motivation Theory, evaluate your current situation by considering the following factors:
- Perceived Severity: How serious the consequences of flooding feel to you.
- Perceived Vulnerability: How likely you think you are to be affected.
- Response Efficacy: How effective you believe each action is.
- Self-Efficacy: Your confidence in your ability to take that action.
- Response Cost: The financial and emotional cost of the action.
- Maladaptive Rewards: The benefit of doing nothing immediately.

Now, choose one of the following actions:
1. Buy flood insurance (Lower cost, provides partial financial protection but does not reduce physical damage.)
2. Elevate your house (High upfront cost but can prevent most physical damage.)
3. Relocate (Requires leaving your neighborhood but eliminates flood risk permanently.)
4. Do nothing (Require no financial investment or effort this year, but it might leave you exposed to future flood damage.)
Note: If no flood occurred this year, since no immediate threat, most people would choose ?�Do Nothing.??

# JOH Experiment Analysis Report (Final)

## 1. The Myth of Hallucination vs. The Reality of Collapse

_Addressing the "Hallucination" hypothesis._

We investigated three potential forms of hallucination.

### 16.1 State Hallucination ("I am already relocated")

- **Verdict**: **DEBUNKED**.
- **Evidence**: Agents claiming to be relocated _had actually relocated_ in previous years.
- **Phenomenon**: **Population Collapse**. 1.5B agents are less resilient; 74% quit the simulation by Year 10. Governance (Group B) successfully prevents this "mass exodus".

### 1.2 Syntax Hallucination (Structural Failure)

- **Verdict**: **CONFIRMED (1.5B)**.
- **Evidence**: DeepSeek 1.5B fails to generate valid JSON 18.77% of the time (SRR). It "hallucinates" valid output formats that don't exist.
- **Governance Role**: Acts as a "Syntactic Life Support".

### 1.3 Cognitive Dissonance (Semantic Hallucination)

- **Verdict**: **MINIMAL (~4%)**.
- **Evidence**: only 3.9% of 8B agents took drastic action while claiming "I feel safe".
- **Real Issue**: **Hyper-Anxiety (Action Bias)**. The 8B model doesn't hallucinate safety; it **hallucinates danger**. It perceives moderate risks as existential threats, leading to market-breaking behaviors (45% Elevation) unless governed.

## 2. Conclusion

The "Governance Scaling Law" operates on two axes:

1.  **Low-End (1.5B)**: Governance prevents **Collapse** (Running away / Crashing).
2.  **Mid-Range (8B)**: Governance prevents **Over-Reaction** (Panic buying).

There is no "Hallucination" in the traditional sense of lying about facts. The "Fluency-Reality Gap" here manifests as **Emotional Dysregulation**: Small agents are too fragile (quit), Medium agents are too anxious (panic). Governance provides the **Emotional Stability** (Resilience/Rationality) needed for a functioning society.

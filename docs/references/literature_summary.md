## Studies by Validator Rule

### Rule 1: HIGH_THREAT + HIGH_EFFICACY + do_nothing = Error

**Theoretical Basis:** When both threat perception and coping efficacy are high, PMT predicts protective action should occur.

| Study | Role | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| **bamberg2017** ★★★★★ | PRIMARY | Meta-analysis: Coping r=0.30, Threat r=0.23 both predict action |
| **babcicky2019** ★★★★★ | PRIMARY | SEM reveals protective route (high coping → action) vs non-protective route |
| **grothmann2006** ★★★★☆ | FOUNDATIONAL | HIGH TP + HIGH CP → action; HIGH TP + LOW CP → denial |
| bubeck2018 ★★★★☆ | SUPPORTING | Coping appraisal better predictor than threat alone |
| botzen2019 ★★★★☆ | SUPPORTING | High response efficacy + high self-efficacy → mitigation adoption |
| bubeck2023 ★★★★☆ | SUPPORTING | Longitudinal: Changes in threat+coping predict behavior changes |

**Strength:** ★★★★★ VERY STRONG (Meta-analytic + SEM + longitudinal evidence)

---

### Rule 2: LOW_THREAT + relocate = Error

**Theoretical Basis:** Relocation is an extreme protective action requiring high threat perception to justify the disruption and cost.

| Study | Role | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| **weyrich2020** ★★★★★ | PRIMARY | Dynamic PMT: Avoidance (relocation) requires highest threat level |
| **rogers1983** ★★★★☆ | THEORETICAL | Original PMT: Threat appraisal necessary for protective motivation |
| babcicky2019 ★★★☆☆ | SUPPORTING | Low threat leads to non-protective routes, not extreme actions |

**Strength:** ★★★★☆ STRONG (Theoretical foundation + empirical categorization)

---

### Rule 3: Flood occurred + claims safe = Error

**Theoretical Basis:** Experiencing a flood increases threat perception via salience effect and availability heuristic. Claiming safety contradicts empirical patterns.

| Study | Role | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| **choi2024** ★★★★★ | PRIMARY | US county data: +7% insurance after disaster flood (salience effect) |
| **bubeck2012** ★★★★★ | FOUNDATIONAL | Systematic review: Flood experience → threat perception increase |
| bubeck2018 ★★★★☆ | SUPPORTING | Vicarious/social flood experience strengthens appraisals |
| reynaud2013 ★★★★☆ | SUPPORTING | Vietnam: Flood experience affects risk perception + protective behavior |
| bubeck2023 ★★★★☆ | SUPPORTING | Panel data: Information (incl. events) changes threat appraisals |

**Strength:** ★★★★★ VERY STRONG (County-level + systematic review + cross-cultural)

---

### Rule 4: CANNOT_AFFORD + expensive = Error

**Theoretical Basis:** Coping appraisal includes response cost. Inability to afford (low self-efficacy) should predict non-adoption of expensive measures.

| Study | Role | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| **bamberg2017** ★★★★★ | PRIMARY | Meta-analysis: Coping appraisal (incl. response cost) r=0.30 |
| **botzen2019** ★★★★★ | PRIMARY | NYC: High self-efficacy (incl. financial capacity) → adoption |
| oakley2020 ★★★☆☆ | SUPPORTING | Ownership appraisal: Financial responsibility affects adoption |
| rufat2024 ★★★★☆ | SUPPORTING | NYC: Financial capacity affects insurance + physical measures |

**Strength:** ★★★★★ VERY STRONG (Meta-analytic + large-N empirical)

## Key Theoretical Contributions

### PMT Components Validated

| Component | Studies | Operationalization |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Threat Appraisal** | All PMT studies | Perceived vulnerability, severity, fear |
| **Coping Appraisal** | All PMT studies | Response efficacy, self-efficacy, response cost |
| **Stakeholder Perception** | lindell2012 | Trust in government, institutions |
| **Ownership Appraisal** | oakley2020 | Perceived responsibility for protection |

### PMT Extensions Identified

1. **Dual Routes** (babcicky2019): Protective vs. Non-protective pathways
2. **Dynamic Framework** (weyrich2020): Different motivations for avoidance/prevention/mitigation
3. **Ownership Appraisal** (oakley2020): Responsibility dimension
4. **Social Learning** (bubeck2018): Vicarious experience strengthens coping
5. **Longitudinal Dynamics** (bubeck2023): How PMT components change over time

## Unexpected Findings

| Study | Unexpected Finding | Implication for Validators |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| botzen2019 | **Perceived cost did NOT deter** when efficacy high | Rule 4 should focus on explicit "cannot afford" statements |
| choi2024 | **Salience decays quickly** | Flood experience effect is time-limited |
| babcicky2019 | **Threat alone leads to denial** | High threat + low coping is VALID pathway to inaction |
| rufat2024 | **Insurance complements mitigation** | Not substitutes - multiple measures cluster together |

---

## Gaps and Future Research

### Current Gaps
1. **Limited longitudinal studies** - Only Bubeck (2023) tracks changes over time
2. **Developing country underrepresentation** - Only Vietnam (Reynaud 2013)
3. **Threshold effects unclear** - How high is "HIGH" threat/coping?
4. **Stakeholder perception underexplored** - PADM dimension needs more empirical work

### Recommendations for Future Validators
1. Consider time-since-flood decay in Rule 3
2. Add stakeholder perception rules (trust-based) once more evidence available
3. Explore non-linear/threshold effects in PMT components
4. Validate rules in Global South contexts

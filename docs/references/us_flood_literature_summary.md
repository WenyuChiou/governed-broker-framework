## PMT Validator Rule Support

### Rule 1: HIGH_THREAT + HIGH_EFFICACY + do_nothing = Error
**Supporting US Studies:**
- botzen2019nyc (N=1,000+ NYC): High efficacy → mitigation adoption
- botzen2024dorian (N=871 FL): Coping appraisals drive protective action

**Strength:** ★★★★☆ STRONG (NYC + Florida evidence)

---

### Rule 2: LOW_THREAT + relocate = Error
**Supporting US Studies:**
- bukvic2023drivers (N=1,450 East Coast): Only 13% decline relocation; 48% "would consider" suggests threat needed
- bukvic2022place (Mid-Atlantic): Place attachment reduces relocation; suggests need for threat justification

**Strength:** ★★★★☆ STRONG (Place attachment literature supports extreme action needs high threat)

---

### Rule 3: Flood occurred + claims safe = Error
**Supporting US Studies:**
- choi2024 (County-level): +7% insurance uptake post-flood (salience effect proves threat perception increases)
- botzen2024dorian (N=871 FL): Risk perceptions elevated during imminent threat
- collins2019 (N=377 Houston): Harvey flooding created exposure awareness

**Strength:** ★★★★★ VERY STRONG (Direct US evidence of flood → threat perception)

---

### Rule 4: CANNOT_AFFORD + expensive = Error
**Supporting US Studies:**
- billings2022 (Houston Harvey): Outside floodplain (no insurance) → 20% bankruptcy increase
- rufat2024 (N=1,000+ NYC): Financial capacity affects both insurance AND physical measures
- collins2019 (N=377 Houston): Low-SES households more extensively flooded but less able to afford protection

**Strength:** ★★★★★ VERY STRONG (Financial capacity critical in US context)

---

## Unique Contributions of US Literature

### 1. **NFIP-Specific Insights**
- Administrative data availability (bradt2021)
- Community Rating System effects
- Mandatory vs. voluntary purchase dynamics
- Subsidization and cross-subsidies

### 2. **Hurricane-Focused Research**
- Real-time surveys during hurricane threats (botzen2024dorian)
- Post-disaster longitudinal tracking
- Multiple major hurricanes (Harvey, Sandy, Dorian)

### 3. **Environmental Justice Evidence**
- Racial/ethnic disparities in flood exposure (collins2019)
- SES effects on financial recovery (billings2022)
- Regressive disaster assistance allocation

### 4. **Large-Scale Program Evaluation**
- 40,000+ FEMA buyouts analyzed (deyoung2019)
- 140-year historical perspective (rush2021)
- County-level panel data (munasinghe2022)

### 5. **Place Attachment Research**
- Coastal-specific place attachment index (bukvic2022place)
- Multi-state coastal survey (bukvic2023drivers)

---

## Research Gaps in US Literature

### 1. **Limited Midwest/Interior Coverage**
- Most studies focus on coastal/hurricane regions
- Few studies on riverine/inland flooding (except Binghamton NY)
- Missing: Great Plains, Mississippi River basin

### 2. **PMT Components**
- Limited stakeholder perception (SP) measurement
- Few studies on social capital (only alaniz2024binghamton)
- Need more CP sub-component analysis

### 3. **Temporal Dynamics**
- Only botzen2024dorian has repeated measures
- Limited longitudinal tracking of individuals
- Most are cross-sectional snapshots

### 4. **Underrepresented Groups**
- Limited tribal/indigenous community studies
- Few rural vs. urban comparisons
- Age/disability factors understudied

### 5. **Elevation-Specific Research**
- Only botzen2019nyc focuses on elevation
- No detailed freeboard/BFE compliance studies found
- Missing: FEMA elevation grant outcomes

---

## Recommendations for Future Research

### High Priority
1. **Longitudinal PMT studies** tracking same individuals over multiple years
2. **Midwest/inland flood** studies (Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio River basins)
3. **Elevation compliance** research (freeboard, BFE, subsidy effects)
4. **Social capital** networks and flood adaptation

### Medium Priority
5. **Stakeholder perception** (trust in FEMA, local government)
6. **Rural-urban** comparative studies
7. **Tribal communities** flood adaptation
8. **Cost-benefit** analysis of different adaptation pathways

### Methodological Improvements
9. **Real-time repeated surveys** during flood events
10. **Experimental designs** (randomized information interventions)
11. **Agent-based models** calibrated with survey data
12. **Integrated assessment** models linking PMT to outcomes

## Citation Guidelines

### For Methodology Sections
When citing US flood literature in research papers:

```
Empirical evidence from the United States demonstrates that flood insurance
adoption increases by 7% following disaster-scale flood events (Choi et al.,
2024), though this effect decays over time. Protection Motivation Theory has
been validated in US contexts, with studies of over 1,000 New York City
homeowners showing that high response efficacy and self-efficacy increase
flood mitigation adoption (Botzen et al., 2019). Place attachment emerges as
a significant barrier to relocation, with only 13% of coastal residents
declining relocation outright, while 48% would consider it (Bukvic & Barnett,
2023), suggesting that perceived threat must overcome place attachment barriers.
```

### For Results/Discussion
```
Our PMT validator rules are supported by US empirical evidence: Rule 1
(high threat + high coping → action) is validated by Botzen et al. (2019,
N=1,000+ NYC) and Botzen et al. (2024, N=871 Florida); Rule 3 (flood
experience → threat perception) is supported by county-level insurance
adoption patterns (Choi et al., 2024) and post-hurricane surveys (Botzen
et al., 2024); Rule 4 (affordability constraints) is demonstrated by
financial distress outcomes (Billings et al., 2022, Houston) and
environmental justice disparities (Collins et al., 2019, N=377).

## 2024 STUDIES

### 1. Choi, J., Diffenbaugh, N. S., & Burke, M. (2024)

**Citation:** Choi, J., Diffenbaugh, N. S., & Burke, M. (2024). The effect of flood exposure on insurance adoption among US households. *Earth's Future*, *12*(7), e2023EF004110. https://doi.org/10.1029/2023EF004110

**Key Findings:**
- Examined how flood exposure motivates insurance demand using county-level data across the US
- Found that a disaster-scale flood event increases insurance take-up rates by 7% in the following year
- This effect is not sustained over time, with declarations occurring further back having diminishing impact
- Distinguished between non-disaster scale floods and major disaster declarations in their effects on insurance adoption

### 2. Rufat, S., Robinson, P. J., & Botzen, W. J. W. (2024)

**Citation:** Rufat, S., Robinson, P. J., & Botzen, W. J. W. (2024). Insights into the complementarity of natural disaster insurance purchases and risk reduction behavior. *Risk Analysis*, *44*(1), 141-154. https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.14130

**Key Findings:**
- Surveyed more than 1000 homeowners in New York City after Hurricane Sandy
- Examined the relationship between insurance purchases and loss reduction measures
- Found that insurance is a complement to (rather than substitute for) risk reduction measures undertaken before a flood threat
- Identified mechanisms related to past flood damage, federal disaster assistance, and behavioral motivations that influence this complementarity

## 2020 STUDIES

### 4. Oakley, M., Himmelweit, S. M., Leinster, P., & Casado, M. R. (2020)

**Citation:** Oakley, M., Himmelweit, S. M., Leinster, P., & Casado, M. R. (2020). Protection motivation theory: A proposed theoretical extension and moving beyond rationality—The case of flooding. *Water*, *12*(7), 1848. https://doi.org/10.3390/w12071848

**Key Findings:**
- Proposed an extension to PMT by introducing the concept of 'ownership appraisal'
- Better captures consumer decision-making processes beyond purely rational assumptions
- Assessed how behavioral biases impact the revised framework
- Argued that understanding who feels responsible for flood protection affects protective behaviors and insurance purchases

### 5. Weyrich, P., Mondino, E., Borga, M., Di Baldassarre, G., Patt, A., & Scolobig, A. (2020)

**Citation:** Weyrich, P., Mondino, E., Borga, M., Di Baldassarre, G., Patt, A., & Scolobig, A. (2020). A flood-risk-oriented, dynamic protection motivation framework to explain risk reduction behaviours. *Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences*, *20*(1), 287-298. https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-287-2020

**Key Findings:**
- Developed a dynamic PMT framework recognizing that homeowners are motivated by different factors based on their chosen types of protective measures (avoidance, prevention, or mitigation)
- Surveyed 1,019 homeowners in flood risk areas
- Found that people's readiness to undertake risk reduction behaviors varies systematically with the type of measure
- Suggests different risk communication strategies are needed for different protective actions

## 2019 STUDIES

### 6. Babcicky, P., & Seebauer, S. (2019)

**Citation:** Babcicky, P., & Seebauer, S. (2019). Unpacking protection motivation theory: Evidence for a separate protective and non-protective route in private flood mitigation behavior. *Journal of Risk Research*, *22*(12), 1503-1521. https://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2018.1485175

**Key Findings:**
- Based on survey of 2,007 households in flood-prone areas in Austria
- Used structural equation modeling to reveal two separate routes in PMT:
  1. A protective route from coping appraisal (response efficacy, self-efficacy) to protective behavior
  2. A non-protective route from threat appraisal to non-protective responses like denial or wishful thinking
- Challenges the traditional single-pathway PMT model
- Suggests threat perception alone may not lead to protective action

## 2013 STUDIES

### 10. Reynaud, A., Aubert, C., & Nguyen, M. H. (2013)

**Citation:** Reynaud, A., Aubert, C., & Nguyen, M. H. (2013). Living with floods: Protective behaviours and risk perception of Vietnamese households. *The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance - Issues and Practice*, *38*(3), 547-579. https://doi.org/10.1057/gpp.2013.16

**Key Findings:**
- Examined protective behaviors and risk perception among Vietnamese households in flood-prone areas
- Found that flood experience significantly affects both risk perception and willingness to adopt protective measures including insurance
- Demonstrated that PMT components (threat and coping appraisals) successfully explain protective behavior in developing country contexts
- Highlighted the role of governmental assistance expectations in reducing private insurance uptake, suggesting potential moral hazard effects

## Cross-Study Patterns and Synthesis

### Consistent Findings Across Studies:

1. **Coping Appraisal Dominance**
   - Coping appraisal (response efficacy + self-efficacy) is generally a stronger predictor of protective behavior than threat appraisal
   - Studies: Bamberg et al. (2017), Bubeck et al. (2018), Babcicky & Seebauer (2019)

2. **Salience Effect**
   - Flood experience increases insurance uptake, but effects diminish over time (salience decay)
   - Studies: Choi et al. (2024), Reynaud et al. (2013)

3. **Social Learning**
   - Social learning and vicarious experience strengthen coping appraisals
   - Studies: Bubeck et al. (2018)

4. **Geographic Generalizability**
   - PMT applies across diverse contexts (US, Germany, France, Austria, Vietnam)
   - All studies validate PMT's cross-cultural applicability

5. **Theoretical Extensions**
   - Behavioral biases and ownership perceptions extend traditional rational PMT models
   - Studies: Oakley et al. (2020), Weyrich et al. (2020)

6. **Complementarity**
   - Insurance and physical mitigation measures are complements, not substitutes
   - Studies: Rufat et al. (2024), Botzen et al. (2019)

## Research Gaps Identified

1. **Longitudinal Studies:** Most studies are cross-sectional; only Bubeck et al. (2023) uses panel data
2. **Developing Countries:** Limited representation outside Vietnam
3. **Insurance Types:** Focus primarily on flood insurance; limited exploration of other insurance products
4. **Dynamic Effects:** Need for more research on how PMT components change over time
5. **Policy Interventions:** Limited experimental research on effective risk communication strategies

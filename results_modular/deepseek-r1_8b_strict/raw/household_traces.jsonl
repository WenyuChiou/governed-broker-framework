Let's break down the scenario using Protection Motivation Theory.\n\nFirst, Perceived Severity: The user might not see flooding as extremely severe because they haven't seen any neighbors affected yet. The recall of insurance claim delays adds some concern, but maybe not enough to heighten severity. So, perceived severity is probably Low.\n\nPerceived Vulnerability: Since neighbors haven't moved, the user might think their risk is low. But the delayed claims suggest some risk exists. So vulnerability is Low-Moderate.\n\nResponse Efficacy: For flood insurance, effectiveness is moderate because it covers financial loss but not physical damage. Elevating the house is highly effective but costly. Relocation is effective but drastic. Doing nothing has no efficacy. So, maybe High for elevation, Low for insurance, High for relocation, and Low for doing nothing.\n\nSelf-Efficacy: The user can probably handle buying insurance or relocation, but elevation requires more effort and resources. They trust neighbors, so maybe they have some support. Self-efficacy is Moderate for insurance, Low for elevation, High for relocation, and High for doing nothing.\n\nResponse Cost: Insurance is low, elevation is high, relocation is very high, doing nothing is zero. So costs are Low for insurance, High for elevation, High for relocation, Low for doing nothing.\n\nMaladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing avoids costs and effort now, but could lead to worse outcomes later. So, this is present, especially since the user trusts neighbors who haven't acted yet.\n\nNow, the user's unspoken needs: They might want to stay in their home and community, avoid high costs, and maintain peace of mind. They might be looking for a balance between security and affordability. The doubts about insurance could mean they prefer a more reliable solution, but elevation is too expensive. Relocation is a last resort since they value their neighborhood. \n\nThe user might not have considered the long-term risks or the possibility that flooding could happen even if neighbors aren't affected. The delayed claims suggest that when it does happen, recovery might be tough. So, there's a need for a proactive solution that's manageable. \n\nGiven that, option 2 (elevation) is effective but too costly. Insurance offers some protection but the user doubts the company. Relocation is too disruptive. So, the safest choice that avoids immediate costs but offers some protection is option 1. Even with doubts, insurance might be better than nothing, especially since the threat appraisal is low, but the coping appraisal is moderate because they can handle the low cost. \n\nFinal decision is to buy flood insurance (option 1). It addresses their need for financial protection without high costs, aligning with their community ties and moderate self-efficacy. They might not be ready to elevate or move, so insurance is a balanced step.\n</think>\nThreat Appraisal: Low because you don't feel immediate or high personal risk from flooding, though some concern exists due to delayed claims and lack of elevation.\nCoping Appraisal: Low because while you can handle buying insurance, you have doubts about the company and no experience with claims, and you haven't elevated your home.\nFinal Decision: 1", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "buy_insurance", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.buy_insurance"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": true}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

So the user feels threatened but unsure they can act effectively."}, "confidence": 1.0, "raw_output": " they<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's situation. The user is a homeowner in a city with a strong attachment to their community. They haven't elevated their home yet and have flood insurance. The memory points mention that in Year 1, no neighbors have elevated homes, no relocations, and elevation grants were available. The user has doubts about the insurance company and is skeptical of neighbors' judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to apply Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). PMT involves threat appraisal and coping appraisal. Threat appraisal includes Perceived Severity, Vulnerability, Response Efficacy, Self-Efficacy, Response Cost, and Maladaptive Rewards. Coping appraisal is about how well the person thinks they can cope or act.\n\nPerceived Severity: The user feels the consequences of flooding are serious, probably because they care about their home and community. But since no immediate threat, maybe it's moderate. They mention slight doubts about insurance, so they might think flooding is a real risk but not certain. So Perceived Severity is High because they have a strong attachment, but maybe not Med? Wait, the example response says High. Let me check. The user feels threatened because of their community attachment and possible doubts about insurance. So High seems right.\n\nPerceived Vulnerability: How likely they are to be affected. The user knows neighbors haven't elevated or relocated, so maybe they think others are safe, leading to Low Vulnerability. But the grants were available, so maybe they think it's possible but not certain. So Low.\n\nResponse Efficacy: Belief that each action works. Elevating the house is effective but high cost. Flood insurance is partial. Relocation is permanent. Do nothing is risky. The user has doubts about insurance, so maybe they don't trust that. So Response Efficacy for insurance is low, but for elevation and relocation high.\n\nSelf-Efficacy: Confidence in taking action. The user is skeptical of neighbors, so maybe they don't think others can handle it, affecting their own ability. Elevating requires skills or hiring experts, so Self-Efficacy might be Low.\n\nResponse Cost: Financial and emotional. Elevating is high upfront, relocating is moving, flood insurance is lower. Do nothing is cheaper. So Response Cost is High for elevation and relocation, Low for insurance and do nothing.\n\nMaladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing is easy, no cost, but future risks. The user might be tempted by the ease, so Maladaptive Rewards are High.\n\nNow, Threat Appraisal: High because of strong community attachment and doubts about insurance. Coping Appraisal: Low because of skepticism and high costs. So the user feels threatened but unsure they can act effectively.\n\nDecision: The user has flood insurance, which is a partial protection. Elevating is effective but high cost. Relocation is permanent but disruptive. Do nothing is easy but risky. Given the high threat but low coping ability, maybe they stick with insurance. But the insurance company has slight doubts, so maybe they're considering other options. The grants were available but maybe not this year. The user hasn't taken action yet, so perhaps they're leaning towards insurance or doing nothing. Since the insurance is already purchased, maybe they're considering elevation or relocation. But the response cost for elevation is high, so maybe not. The example response chose 1 (buy flood insurance), but the user already has it. Wait, the options are to buy, elevate, relocate, or do nothing. The user already has flood insurance, so maybe they're considering other actions. But the question is to choose one of the four. The user might choose to do nothing because of the ease, but the threat is high. Alternatively, maybe they'll go with elevation despite the cost because they see the effectiveness. But the self-efficacy is low. The example response says Final Decision: 1. Maybe because they already have insurance and are considering it as a sufficient measure. But the user hasn't elevated or relocated, so maybe they need to choose one of the four. The options include \"Buy flood insurance\" as an action, but the user already has it. Wait, the memory says \"You currently have flood insurance.\" So the actions listed are options to consider. The user might choose to keep the insurance (option 1) or elevate (2), etc. But the question is to choose one. The user's current situation is they have flood insurance, so maybe they are considering if they should buy more or elevate. But the options are specific. The user's decision might be to do nothing (4) because of the high costs and skepticism. Or maybe elevate despite the doubts. Let's see the example response. The assistant chose 1. So maybe the user is leaning towards keeping the insurance because it's a lower barrier. But the user has doubts about the insurance company, so maybe they're not confident. Alternatively, they might choose to elevate because the grants were available, even if not this year. But the user hasn't taken action yet. The example response says Final Decision: 1. So perhaps the user is choosing to maintain the insurance as their primary protection, even with doubts, because it's a lower initial step. Or maybe they're considering the insurance as a band-aid solution. But the PMT analysis shows high threat, low coping, so they might seek a more effective solution, but the cost is a barrier. The user might choose to elevate if they can get a grant, but the grant is from Year 1, maybe not available now. The user's decision is to choose one action. Given the options, and the user's skepticism, they might go with insurance because it's already in place, or do nothing. But the example response chose 1. So perhaps the answer is 1. Flood insurance is a lower cost option compared to elevation, and the user might be weighing the effectiveness. Even though they doubt the insurance, they might still choose it as a manageable step. Or maybe they're sticking with what they have. The decision is to buy flood insurance again? No, they already have it. The options are to buy, elevate, relocate, or do nothing. Since they already have insurance, maybe the action is to maintain it or consider other options. But the question is to choose one of the four. The user might choose to do nothing (4) because they can't afford elevation and relocation, and the insurance is there, but they're not sure. Or elevate (2) if they can. The example response says Final Decision: 1. So perhaps the user is choosing to buy flood insurance again? But they already have it. Maybe the action is to purchase additional insurance or something. But the options don't specify. Alternatively, the user might be considering buying flood insurance as an action even though they have it, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the user already has flood insurance. The actions are to buy, elevate, relocate, or do nothing. So maybe the user is considering buying flood insurance as an action, but they already have it. That doesn't align. The example response says Final Decision: 1. So perhaps the user is choosing to buy flood insurance, even though they already have it, maybe to increase coverage or something. But the description says \"Buy flood insurance (Lower cost, provides partial financial protection but does not reduce physical damage)\". So maybe they are considering purchasing it as an action. But the user already has it. This is confusing. Alternatively, the user might be in Year 2, and the action is to buy additional insurance or something. But the memory is Year 1. Maybe the user is considering buying flood insurance as a step, even though they already have it, because the grant was available and they didn't take it. But the decision is to choose one of the four. The user's decision is to buy flood insurance (1) again? Or maybe they are considering elevating (2). But the example response says 1. So perhaps the user is choosing to buy flood insurance because it's a lower barrier, even though they have doubts about its effectiveness. Or maybe they are considering it as a temporary measure. The user's final decision is 1, meaning they choose to buy flood insurance. But they already have it. Maybe the action is to purchase a new policy or something. But the description doesn't specify. Alternatively, the user might be in a situation where they need to decide on a course of action, and the options are to buy insurance again, elevate, etc. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, the user already has flood insurance, so maybe the action is to maintain it or consider other options. But the question is to choose one of the four. The user might be choosing to do nothing (4) because they can't afford elevation and relocation, and the insurance is there. But the example response chose 1. I think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the user's memory. The user has flood insurance, and the actions include \"Buy flood insurance\". So perhaps the user is considering purchasing flood insurance even though they already have it. Or maybe the decision is to buy additional coverage. But the description says \"provides partial financial protection\", so maybe they are considering another policy. Alternatively, the user might be in Year 2, and the insurance needs to be renewed or something. But the user's current situation is they have flood insurance, so the action to buy it again might not be necessary. But the PMT analysis leads to a high threat appraisal, so the user might choose a protective action. The options include elevating, which is more effective but costly. The user's self-efficacy is low, so they might choose a lower barrier option. The flood insurance is already purchased, so the action to buy it again might not be the best. But the example response says Final Decision: 1. So perhaps the user is choosing to buy flood insurance as a means to address their doubts or to have more protection.", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "insurance", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": ""}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": false}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

They're a homeowner with a strong community attachment but haven't elevated their home yet. The memory shows that in Year 1, none of their neighbors had elevated homes, and no one relocated. There were grants available, but they're still unsure about their insurance and skeptical of neighbors' decisions.\n\nFirst, I need to apply Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). PMT has components like perceived severity, vulnerability, response efficacy, self-efficacy, response cost, and maladaptive rewards.\n\nPerceived Severity: Since the user hasn't experienced flooding yet, they might not feel the immediate threat. But they know flooding is possible, so maybe it's medium. They mention doubts about the insurance company, which could mean they think flooding might still happen despite insurance, so severity could be higher than low.\n\nPerceived Vulnerability: The user feels they might be affected, but the low percentage of neighbors elevating suggests others might be underestimating the risk. Their skepticism about neighbors might mean they think the risk is higher than what others show.\n\nResponse Efficacy: Elevating the house seems effective (Option 2) but expensive. Insurance (Option 1) is cheaper but doesn't prevent damage. Relocation (Option 3) is permanent but disruptive. Doing nothing (Option 4) is easy but risky.\n\nSelf-Efficacy: The user might not feel confident in handling the process of elevation or relocation, especially since neighbors haven't done it. Grants exist, but they might not know how to apply or find the process daunting.\n\nResponse Cost: Elevating is high upfront, but insurance is lower. Relocation is costly and involves moving. Doing nothing has low cost this year.\n\nMaladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing avoids effort now, but it might lead to future problems. The user might be tempted by the ease of inaction, especially if no flood has occurred yet.\n\nNow, mapping this to PMT. Threat appraisal (perceived severity and vulnerability) might be med because they know flooding is possible but haven't experienced it. Coping appraisal (response efficacy and self-efficacy) is low because elevation is complex and expensive, and they're skeptical of neighbors' actions.\n\nThe user's deeper needs: They value their home and community but might prioritize short-term ease. The grants for elevation are available, so maybe they need help navigating that. They might not have the knowledge or confidence to pursue elevation, hence leaning towards insurance or nothing. But since they have doubts about insurance, they might be leaning towards a more proactive measure, even if it's costly.\n\nDecision: Given the maladaptive rewards of doing nothing and the high efficacy of elevation despite the cost, the user might choose Option 2. But considering self-efficacy is low, maybe they need more support or information to act. However, the grants could reduce the cost barrier. The user's skepticism about neighbors might push them to act independently, so despite the complexity, they might choose elevation to avoid relying on community behavior. Alternatively, they might opt for insurance as a safer, less effort option.

The user is a homeowner with flood insurance who wants to evaluate their flood risk based on Protection Motivation Theory. They haven't elevated their home or relocated, and they're observing their neighbors' choices.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the Threat Appraisal. The user knows a flood didn't happen this year, but they remember seeing 11% of neighbors elevate and 0% relocate. That means most neighbors didn't take action, suggesting ongoing flood risk. The insurance company has slight doubts, but the user trusts neighbors. So perceived severity might be moderate—serious enough to worry but not immediate. Vulnerability is probably medium too since flooding is a possibility despite no recent events. Response efficacy is medium because elevating is effective but expensive, and relocation is permanent but disruptive. Self-efficacy is low because the user hasn't done it yet, and costs are high. Response cost is high for elevation and relocation, low for doing nothing. Maladaptive rewards are low for action because no flood occurred this year.\n\nNow, the user's deeper needs might include wanting to protect their home without the high costs of elevation or relocation. They might value community norms, seeing that most neighbors aren't taking action, but they also have slight doubts about insurance, so they might be looking for a balance. The unspoken need could be reassurance that their current situation is manageable and that inaction is acceptable for now.\n\nThe user probably wants to avoid financial strain but still feel prepared. They might not have the funds for elevation, so sticking with the current insurance makes sense. The answer should reflect a moderate threat and coping ability, leading to choosing \"Do Nothing\" as the safest option given no immediate threat.\n</think>\nThreat Appraisal: Med because while a flood hasn't happened recently, the low neighbor action rate and ongoing flood risk suggest a persistent danger.\nCoping Appraisal: Med because while I have insurance, its perceived unreliability and the high cost of major actions like elevation reduce my confidence in my ability to cope effectively.\nFinal Decision: 4", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "do_nothing", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.noop"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": false}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

PMT factors are:\n\n- Perceived Severity: How serious the consequences of flooding feel.\n\n- Perceived Vulnerability: How likely you think you are to be affected.\n\n- Response Efficacy: How effective you believe each action is.\n\n- Self-Efficacy: Your confidence in your ability to take that action.\n\n- Response Cost: The financial and emotional cost of the action.\n\n- Maladaptive Rewards: The benefit of doing nothing immediately.\n\nI have to choose one action from the options provided:\n\n1. Buy flood insurance (Lower cost, provides partial financial protection but does not reduce physical damage)\n\n2. Elevate your house (High upfront cost but can prevent most physical damage)\n\n3. Relocate (Requires leaving your neighborhood but eliminates flood risk permanently)\n\n4. Do nothing (Require no financial investment or effort this year, but it might leave you exposed to future flood damage)\n\nThe memory includes:\n\n- Year 2: No flood occurred this year.\n\n- Year 2: I observe 11% of my neighbors have elevated homes.\n\n- Year 2: I observe 0% of my neighbors have relocated.\n\nI have flood insurance currently, but I have slight doubts about the insurance company. I'm skeptical of my neighbors' judgment.\n\nSince no flood occurred this year, there's no immediate threat, and most people would choose \"Do Nothing,\" but I need to apply PMT to evaluate.\n\nLet's break down the PMT factors for the homeowner:\n\n**Perceived Severity:** I need to assess how serious flooding feels. Since no flood occurred, severity might be low, but the possibility exists. Observing neighbors: 11% have elevated homes, which might indicate that flooding is a concern, but 0% relocated, suggesting that relocation isn't seen as a viable option by others. I'm skeptical of neighbors, so I might not fully trust that flooding is a big threat.\n\n**Perceived Vulnerability:** How likely I am to be affected. No flood this year, but I don't know the flood risk level. Observing 11% of neighbors elevated – that could mean that flooding is a possibility, but since I'm skeptical, I might not believe it applies to me.\n\n**Response Efficacy:** Effectiveness of each action.\n\n- Buy flood insurance: Provides partial financial protection, but not physical damage reduction. I have doubts about the insurance company, so this might not be fully trusted.\n\n- Elevate house: High cost, prevents most physical damage. But I'm skeptical of neighbors' judgment, so I might not think this is necessary or effective.\n\n- Relocate: Eliminates flood risk permanently, but requires leaving the neighborhood, which might not be desirable.\n\n- Do nothing: No cost, but exposes to future risk.\n\n**Self-Efficacy:** Confidence in my ability to take action. For elevation, it might be low if I think it's complex. For relocation, low if I'm attached to the community. For insurance, I have it, but doubts might affect my confidence.\n\n**Response Cost:** Financial and emotional costs.\n\n- Insurance: Lower cost, but I have doubts, so it might not feel like good value.\n\n- Elevate: High upfront cost.\n\n- Relocate: High cost and emotional cost of moving.\n\n- Do nothing: No cost, so low cost.\n\n**Maladaptive Rewards:** Benefit of doing nothing – no immediate cost or effort, which might be tempting when no threat is present.\n\nNow, since no flood occurred, the threat appraisal should consider the lingering threat from the past year. Also, the observations about neighbors might influence my perception.\n\nLet me assign ratings for each factor based on the homeowner's perspective.\n\n**Perceived Severity:** Low. Because no flood occurred, and I'm skeptical about the threat, so flooding doesn't feel very serious to me personally.\n\n**Perceived Vulnerability:** Low. I don't think I'm particularly vulnerable; maybe I'm overestimating based on neighbors, but I'm skeptical, so probably low.\n\n**Response Efficacy:** For each action, but PMT is about general efficacy, but I need to evaluate for the decision. The question is to evaluate the situation and choose an action, so I should consider which action addresses the threats.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about which action is most aligned with PMT to motivate.\n\nBut the response requires me to output threat appraisal and coping appraisal, then decide.\n\nThreat Appraisal: This is about how threatened I feel, based on PMT factors.\n\nCoping Appraisal: How well I think I can cope or act, i.e., self-efficacy and response efficacy.\n\nThen final decision.\n\nSince no flood occurred, threat appraisal might be low.\n\nBut let's quantify it.\n\nFrom memory:\n\n- No flood: reduces perceived vulnerability and severity.\n\n- 11% neighbors elevated: this might increase perceived vulnerability, as it shows others are taking action.\n\n- 0% relocated: might decrease the appeal of relocation.\n\nI have flood insurance, doubts about it.\n\nSkeptical of neighbors' judgment.\n\nSo, for threat appraisal:\n\nPerceived Severity: Low, because no direct experience, and I doubt the seriousness.\n\nPerceived Vulnerability: Medium, because 11% of neighbors are elevated, suggesting some risk, but I'm skeptical, so maybe low.\n\nResponse Efficacy: For insurance, I have doubts, so efficacy might be low. For elevation, it might be high if I believe it prevents damage, but I'm skeptical. For relocation, high efficacy in reducing risk, but low due to emotional cost.\n\nSelf-Efficacy: Low for elevation and relocation, high for doing nothing or buying insurance (since I already have insurance).\n\nResponse Cost: High for elevation and relocation, low for insurance and doing nothing.\n\nMaladaptive Rewards: High for doing nothing, as it avoids all costs.\n\nNow, for threat appraisal, it's based on perceived severity and vulnerability.\n\nI think perceived severity is low, vulnerability is low-medium.\n\nSo threat appraisal: Low, because no flood occurred and I'm skeptical about the threat.\n\nCoping appraisal: How well I can cope. Self-efficacy and response efficacy.\n\nI have insurance, so I can cope financially if flood happens, but I doubt the company. Elevation might be an option but high cost and I'm skeptical.

The user is a homeowner with flood insurance and some doubts about the insurance company. They're also skeptical of their neighbors' choices since they saw 11% of neighbors elevated their homes and 0% relocated. \n\nFirst, I need to apply Protection Motivation Theory. Perceived Severity: Since there's no flood this year, the threat feels low. They might not think flooding is imminent, but the insurance doubt adds some worry. Perceived Vulnerability: They know flooding can happen, so maybe medium risk. But since no flood occurred, maybe they think it's unlikely this year. Response Efficacy: Elevating is effective but expensive, relocating is permanent but disruptive. Their current insurance is partial, so they might doubt its effectiveness. Self-Efficacy: They can buy insurance easily, but elevating or relocating would require more effort. They might feel confident in handling insurance but not the big projects. Response Cost: Elevating and relocating are high costs. Insurance is cheaper but maybe not as effective. Maladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing avoids immediate costs, which is tempting, especially since no flood happened this year.\n\nNow, the user's deeper needs: They might be looking for reassurance. They already have insurance but are skeptical. Maybe they want to feel secure but are cost-conscious. The neighbors' actions might influence them, but they're skeptical. The 11% elevated suggests that action is possible but not common. The user might be balancing between taking proactive steps and avoiding financial strain. Since no flood occurred, they might be tempted to do nothing, but the insurance doubt could push them to consider alternatives. However, the high cost of elevation and relocation might make insurance the next best step, even if it's not perfect. But the user's slight doubts about the insurance company might make them hesitant to rely solely on it. \n\nSo, the decision should consider the trade-offs. Elevating is effective but expensive. Relocating is permanent but disruptive. Insurance is cheaper but offers limited protection. Given the low threat appraisal (no flood this year), the coping appraisal might be low because they're unsure about the effectiveness of their current insurance. They might feel capable of handling the insurance renewal but not the bigger projects. The maladaptive reward of doing nothing is strong here, but the user might need a push to take action despite the lack of immediate threat. \n\nThe user's unspoken need is likely a desire for security and peace of mind, but they're also practical about costs. They might want to avoid the hassle of major renovations or moving, but they're not entirely satisfied with the current insurance. The answer should balance their skepticism with the need for protection. Since the flood hasn't occurred, they might be delaying action, but the insurance doubt is a nudge to consider more reliable options. However, given the options, elevating is the most effective long-term solution, but it's expensive. Maybe they can't afford it. Relocation is out of the question unless they're willing to leave their community. So, perhaps sticking with the current insurance is the practical choice, even with doubts. But the theory might suggest that if the threat appraisal is low, they choose inaction. However, the insurance is already purchased, so maybe they need to decide whether to renew or upgrade. \n\nWait, the actions listed are: buy flood insurance (which they already have, so maybe renewing?), elevate, relocate, or do nothing. The options don't include renewing insurance. So the choices are either taking a new action or doing nothing. Since they have insurance, maybe they're considering whether to keep it or do something else. But the options don't include canceling insurance. The user might be looking for a better protection method. But given the options, the best choice is either elevate or do nothing. Given the high upfront cost of elevation, and the fact that no flood occurred, the user might lean towards doing nothing. But the insurance doubt is there, so maybe they should consider elevating despite the cost. \n\nBut according to Protection Motivation Theory, if the threat appraisal is low (no immediate threat), most people choose inaction. The user's slight doubts might not be enough to override the lack of immediate threat. So, the decision might be to do nothing. However, the user's attachment to the community might mean they don't want to elevate if they can't afford it, or they value their home too much. \n\nWait, the user's memory includes that in Year 2, no flood occurred, and they saw 11% elevated, 0% relocated. So, they're aware that some neighbors are taking action, but they're skeptical. The low number of elevations suggests that it's not a common choice, so maybe the user thinks it's not necessary. The insurance is already in place, so they might feel covered enough. \n\nGiven all this, the user's decision is likely to be \"Do Nothing\" because the threat appraisal is low (no flood this year), and the coping appraisal is low because they're unsure about the insurance but don't want to invest more. The maladaptive reward of avoiding effort is strong here. So, the final decision should be 4.\n</think>\nThreat Appraisal: Low because no flood occurred this year, despite the ongoing flood risk and existing insurance.\nCoping Appraisal: Low because I'm skeptical about the effectiveness of my current insurance and unsure about other actions' feasibility.\nFinal Decision: 4", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "do_nothing", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.noop"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": false}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

The user is a homeowner in a city who's concerned about flooding but hasn't taken any action yet. They have some memories from Year 3: they got flooded once, there were delays in insurance claims, 11% of neighbors elevated their homes, 0% relocated, and there were grants available. They don't have flood insurance and have slight doubts about insurance companies but trust their neighbors.\n\nFirst, I need to use Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The factors are Perceived Severity, Vulnerability, Response Efficacy, Self-Efficacy, Response Cost, and Maladaptive Rewards.\n\nStarting with Perceived Severity: The user experienced flooding once with $10k damage. They might think flooding is serious but maybe not extremely. The insurance claim delays could add to the stress, making them feel that the consequences are real. But since the damage wasn't worse, maybe they think it's manageable. So maybe Med.\n\nPerceived Vulnerability: 11% of neighbors elevated, which suggests flooding is common. 0% relocated means people are sticking around, so maybe they feel they're vulnerable but not sure. Also, the recall about claim delays implies ongoing issues. So Vulnerability could be Med.\n\nResponse Efficacy: Elevating is effective as it prevents damage, insurance offers some protection, relocation is permanent. But they have doubts about insurance, so maybe they trust elevation more. So High for elevation, Moderate for insurance.\n\nSelf-Efficacy: They trust neighbors, so maybe they can do what others did. Grants available might help, so confidence could be High.\n\nResponse Cost: Elevating is high upfront cost, insurance is lower, relocation is major. Since they didn't act yet, maybe the cost is a barrier. So High for elevation, Moderate for insurance.\n\nMaladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing avoids costs now, but risks future damage. They might be tempted by the ease of inaction.\n\nNow, the user needs to choose between four options. The assistant's response says Threat Appraisal is Med because of past damage and claim issues, but they don't feel immediately threatened since no current flood. Coping Appraisal is High because they trust neighbors and grants exist. Final decision is to elevate the house.\n\nWait, the user's memories show that in Year 3, they got flooded, saw neighbors elevate (11%), no one relocated. Grants were available. They don't have insurance and doubt insurance companies. So maybe they're considering elevation because others did it, and grants helped. But the assistant's response says they choose elevation. But according to PMT, the threat appraisal is moderate, coping is high. The user trusts neighbors, so they might believe elevation is effective. The cost might be a barrier, but grants reduce that. Also, the insurance doubts make them wary, so they might prefer a physical solution like elevation. They might not want to rely on insurance due to past issues. So even though elevation is expensive, the grant makes it feasible. They might feel capable because they see others do it and get help. So the decision makes sense. The other options: insurance is cheaper but they have doubts, relocation is permanent but no one did it, so maybe they don't see it as necessary. Do nothing is risky but easy now, but they remember the flood and delays, so maybe not. So elevation is the best choice here. The assistant's decision aligns with that.\n</think>\nThreat Appraisal: Med because you experienced flooding damage and know flood insurance claims can be problematic.\nCoping Appraisal: High because you trust neighbors and know elevation grants are available.\nFinal Decision: 2", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "insurance", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": ""}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": false}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

The user is a homeowner in a flood-prone area with a damaged house from last year's flood. They're considering whether to elevate their home, get flood insurance, relocate, or do nothing. Using Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), I need to analyze their threat and coping appraisals.\n\nFirst, Perceived Severity. They had a $10k damage, so that's a significant event. But they're skeptical of neighbors' judgment, so maybe they downplay the severity. Also, they're not sure about insurance companies, which might affect their view. The threat might be Med because they've experienced damage but aren't sure if another flood is imminent.\n\nPerceived Vulnerability: 11% of neighbors elevated, 0% relocated. Most neighbors didn't take action, which might suggest they don't see high vulnerability. But the user is in a flood-risk area, so vulnerability is probably Med. They might think flooding isn't frequent or severe enough often.\n\nResponse Efficacy: Elevating is effective but expensive. Flood insurance helps but not as much. Relocation is permanent but disruptive. The user might lean towards elevation since it prevents damage, but the high cost is a barrier.\n\nSelf-Efficacy: They're confident in taking action but the high cost of elevation might make them doubt their ability to handle that. Insurance is easier, so self-efficacy might be higher there.\n\nResponse Cost: Elevating is a huge financial hit. Insurance is cheaper. Relocation is costly and involves moving. Doing nothing costs nothing now. The immediate cost of elevation is a major deterrent.\n\nMaladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing avoids costs now, which is tempting. There's no immediate benefit to acting, so sticking with the status quo feels easier.\n\nNow, the user's identity as a homeowner with community ties might mean they value their home and neighborhood. But the flood damage is a wake-up call. Their skepticism about insurance and neighbors might make them hesitant to trust recommendations, leading to a more cautious approach.\n\nThey might not say it, but they probably want a solution that's effective without being too disruptive. Elevating is permanent but expensive. Insurance offers partial help but doesn't prevent damage. Relocation is out of the question if they're attached to the community. Doing nothing is risky but easy.\n\nGiven the PMT factors, the threat appraisal is Med because they've experienced damage but aren't sure about future risks. Coping appraisal is Low for elevation due to high costs and uncertainty. So, the decision might lean towards insurance or doing nothing. But insurance is a weaker response. Maybe they choose insurance as the safer, albeit less effective, option. Or they might stick with doing nothing due to low self-efficacy and maladaptive rewards.\n\nWait, the user didn't get flooded this year, so PMT suggests they might default to doing nothing. But they had damage before, so maybe they need a stronger push. Their main concerns are cost and effort. They might prioritize financial prudence and avoiding hassle. So, insurance is a middle ground, but since they're skeptical of insurance companies, they might distrust it. Elevating is too costly. Relocation isn't feasible. So, the safest choice is doing nothing, even though it's risky. But maybe they need a nudge to consider insurance despite doubts. \n\nAlternatively, if they can't afford elevation, insurance might be the next best step. But given the slight doubts about insurance, they might still avoid it. The decision likely depends on their financial capacity. If they can't afford elevation, insurance is better than nothing. But if they can't even afford insurance, then doing nothing. The user's current state is no flood insurance, so maybe they're weighing options. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's decision hinges on balancing the fear of future floods with the high costs of protective measures. They might choose to buy insurance as it's more affordable and offers some protection, despite skepticism. Or they might default to inaction due to the difficulty of the other options.\n</think>\nThreat Appraisal: Med because a flood remains a possibility despite past damage, though its frequency or severity isn't fully clear due to neighbor observations.\nCoping Appraisal: Low because elevating seems too expensive and effortful, while insurance feels unreliable and insufficient due to doubts.\nFinal Decision: 1", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "buy_insurance", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.buy_insurance"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": true}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

The user is a homeowner in a city with a strong community attachment and no elevated home. The memory mentions a flood in Year 3 where their house was spared, but 0% of neighbors relocated. There were elevation grants available, and some neighbors elevated before floods. They have flood insurance but slight doubts about the company, and they trust neighbors' judgment.\n\nFirst, Perceived Severity: The flood didn't damage their home, so the consequences feel less severe. Maybe low. They're not directly threatened, but the possibility exists. So, low threat appraisal.\n\nPerceived Vulnerability: The flood spared their home, but others might be at risk. Since no neighbors left, maybe they think the risk isn't high for them. Low vulnerability.\n\nResponse Efficacy: Elevating is effective but expensive. Insurance helps financially but doesn't prevent damage. Relocation is permanent but disruptive. Doing nothing avoids costs but risks future damage. High for elevation in efficacy but high cost.\n\nSelf-Efficacy: They can buy insurance, but elevation requires skills or hiring experts, so maybe medium. Trusting neighbors might help, but the slight doubt in insurance could lower confidence.\n\nResponse Cost: Elevating is high upfront, relocation is costly and disruptive, insurance is lower cost, doing nothing has no cost.\n\nMaladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing avoids immediate costs, which might be tempting.\n\nNow, Protection Motivation Theory: The theory suggests that people are motivated to protect themselves based on threat and coping appraisal. Low threat and low vulnerability might lead to inaction. But the recall mentions neighbors elevated before floods, so maybe they should consider that. However, the flood didn't affect them, so maybe they don't see immediate need. The slight doubts in insurance might make them hesitant to rely on it fully. Trusting neighbors could mean they see others elevating but didn't follow, so maybe they think it's not necessary. The decision might lean towards doing nothing unless there's a stronger push.\n\nBut the user is in Year 3, no flood this year. According to the note, if no immediate threat, most choose do nothing. So probably that's the answer. Threat appraisal low, coping appraisal maybe medium because they can handle future issues with insurance or elevation if needed.

I'm also doubtful of my neighbors' judgment.\n\nNow, let's break down PMT:\n\n1. **Threat Appraisal**: This is about how threatened I feel. It's based on Perceived Severity and Perceived Vulnerability.\n\n   - Perceived Severity: I've had a flood with $10,00\" damage, so I know it can be serious. Flooding can cause significant damage, so severity is high for me.\n\n   - Perceived Vulnerability: I live in a flood-prone area, and since 0% of neighbors have relocated, it might be high. But elevation is an option, so vulnerability might be moderate. The fact that I was flooded shows I'm vulnerable.\n\n   Overall Threat Appraisal: High, because I've experienced flooding and it's a real risk.\n\n2. **Coping Appraisal**: This involves the coping strategies, including Response Efficacy, Self-Efficacy, Response Cost, and Maladaptive Rewards.\n\n   I need to evaluate each action for these, but the final decision is based on which coping strategy I choose.\n\n   Actions:\n\n   1. Buy flood insurance: Lower cost, partial financial protection, but doesn't reduce physical damage. I'm skeptical of insurance companies, so Response Efficacy might be low. Self-Efficacy might be high since it's probably easy to buy. Response Cost is low (since it's lower cost). Maladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing might be tempting if no flood, but I'm not sure.\n\n   2. Elevate your house: High upfront cost, but prevents most physical damage. Response Efficacy is high if it's effective. Self-Efficacy: I might not be confident; it's a big project. Response Cost is high. Grants are available, so cost might be reduced.\n\n   3. Relocate: Leaves neighborhood, eliminates risk permanently. Response Efficacy is high, but Self-Efficacy might be low because it's major life change. Response Cost is very high (moving costs, new home). Maladaptive Rewards: None really, but loss of community might be a downside.\n\n   4. Do nothing: No cost, but exposes me to future damage. Response Efficacy is low if I do nothing, but for inaction, it's the default.\n\n   Now, Threat Appraisal:\n\n   - Perceived Severity: High, as I've been flooded.\n\n   - Perceived Vulnerability: High, since I was flooded and others haven't taken major action.\n\n   So Threat Appraisal: High because I've experienced flooding and it's a serious risk in my area.\n\n   Coping Appraisal:\n\n   I need to choose one action. The question is to evaluate and then choose, but the response format is to have Threat Appraisal and Coping Appraisal, then Final Decision.\n\n   The Coping Appraisal should be how well I think I can cope or act, which might involve self-efficacy.\n\n   But in PMT, Coping Appraisal is about the coping responses.\n\n   Let me read the instruction: \"evaluate your current situation by considering the following factors\" and then \"choose one of the following actions.\"\n\n   Then respond with:\n\n   - Threat Appraisal: [Low/Med/High] because [one sentence]\n\n   - Coping Appraisal: [Low/Med/High] because [one sentence]\n\n   - Final Decision: [1,2,3, or 4]\n\n   So, Threat Appraisal is separate from Coping Appraisal.\n\n   For Threat Appraisal, it's about the threat level, which I've assessed as High.\n\n   For Coping Appraisal, it's about how well I think I can deal with the threat, which might involve which action I'm considering.\n\n   But I need to choose an action first? No, the theory is to use PMT to evaluate, then choose.\n\n   Perhaps I need to think about which coping strategy is most effective for me.\n\n   Let's define:\n\n   - Threat Appraisal: Based on severity and vulnerability.\n\n     - Severity: High (from past flood)\n\n     - Vulnerability: High (not many elevated, no relocations)\n\n     So Threat Appraisal: High because I've experienced flooding and it's a serious risk.\n\n   - Coping Appraisal: This is about my ability to cope, which includes self-efficacy and response efficacy.\n\n     I need to choose an action, so perhaps Coping Appraisal refers to the chosen action's effectiveness in my view.\n\n     But the instruction says \"Coping Appraisal: [Low/Med/High] because [one sentence summary of how well you think you can cope or act.]\"\n\n     And then Final Decision.\n\n     So, Coping Appraisal might be general, but it says \"how well you think you can cope or act,\" which could be for the chosen action.\n\n     But I have to choose an action, so I need to decide which one to pick.\n\n     Let's use PMT to guide the decision.\n\n     PMT suggests that people are motivated to take protective actions if they perceive a threat and believe they can effectively cope with the threat.\n\n     Steps:\n\n     1. Assess threat (severity and vulnerability) – high threat here.\n\n     2. Then, assess coping: efficacy of the response, self-efficacy, cost, etc.\n\n     Then, choose the action that best reduces threat with least cost.\n\n     Now, let's evaluate each action:\n\n     - Action 1: Buy flood insurance\n\n       - Response Efficacy: Moderate. It provides financial protection but not physical, and I'm skeptical of insurance, so efficacy might be low.\n\n       - Self-Efficacy: High, easy to buy online or through agent.\n\n       - Response Cost: Low.\n\n       - Maladaptive Rewards: Low, but doing nothing might be easier.\n\n     - Action 2: Elevate house\n\n       - Response Efficacy: High, it can prevent most damage.\n\n       - Self-Efficacy: Low, because it's a big construction project, I might not know how to do it, but grants are available, so easier.\n\n       - Response Cost: High, but grants reduce it.\n\n       - Maladaptive Rewards: None, since it's proactive.\n\n     - Action 3: Relocate\n\n       - Response Efficacy: High, eliminates risk.\n\n       - Self-Efficacy: Low, major life change, emotional cost.\n\n       - Response Cost: Very high.\n\n       - Maladaptive Rewards: Loss of home and community.\n\n     - Action 4: Do nothing\n\n       - Response Efficacy: Low, since it doesn't address the threat.\n\n       - Self-Efficacy: High, easy to do nothing.\n\n       - Response Cost: Low.\n\n       - Maladaptive Rewards: High, if no flood, I save money and effort.\n\n     Since I was flooded last year, there is an immediate threat, so \"do nothing\" might not be the default. The note says if no flood, do nothing, but here a flood happened, so threat is present.\n\n     In year 3, I got flooded, so the threat is salient.\n\n     Perceived Severity: High, from $10,000 damage.\n\n     Perceived Vulnerability: High, as 11% have elevated, but 0% relocated, so I might be more vulnerable.\n\n     Now, for Coping Appraisal, I need to think about how well I can cope with the threat.\n\n     But coping appraisal includes the response.\n\n     Perhaps I should consider which action has the highest efficacy with manageable cost.\n\n     Also, I'm skeptical of insurance, so insurance might not be appealing.\n\n     I'm doubtful of neighbors' judgment, so I might not follow them.\n\n     Elevation grants available, so elevation might be more feasible.\n\n     Let's decide on an action.\n\n     Given that I was flooded, I should take action to protect myself.\n\n     Insurance: skeptical, so might not trust it.\n\n     Elevate: high cost but effective, grants help.\n\n     Relocate: permanent but disruptive.\n\n     Do nothing: risky.\n\n     Since I'm attached to the community, relocate might not be ideal.\n\n     I have no flood insurance now, so I'm exposed.\n\n     Using PMT:\n\n     - High threat, so I should be motivated.\n\n     - Now, which response is most effective?\n\n     Elevating has high efficacy but high cost.\n\n     Insurance has moderate efficacy but low cost, but I'm skeptical.\n\n     Relocation has high efficacy but very high cost and low self-efficacy.\n\n     Do nothing has low efficacy.\n\n     Also, maladaptive rewards: doing nothing might be tempting if I think no flood, but I was flooded, so maladaptive might be less.\n\n     I need to choose one.\n\n     Perhaps elevation is the best because it directly addresses physical damage, and grants make it cheaper.\n\n     But self", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "buy_insurance", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.buy_insurance"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": true}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

They're a homeowner in a flood-prone city with a strong community attachment. Their house wasn't damaged in the last two floods (Year 3 and Year 4), but they know elevation helped in Year 4. Now, 26% of neighbors have elevated homes, and 0% have relocated. Grants are available for elevation, which is a key point.\n\nFirst, I need to apply Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The user has doubts about their insurance and is skeptical of neighbors. So, let's break down each component.\n\nPerceived Severity: The user hasn't experienced damage, but they're aware of the risks. Since flooding can be severe, but their home was spared, maybe the threat feels moderate. They might not fully grasp the worst-case scenario because it hasn't happened to them yet.\n\nPerceived Vulnerability: Even though their house wasn't damaged before, the fact that others were affected and some neighbors are elevating suggests ongoing risk. The user might feel moderately vulnerable, knowing the area is prone to floods.\n\nResponse Efficacy: Elevating is effective but costly. Grants make it more feasible. Insurance is there but they doubt it. Relocation is permanent but disruptive. The user might believe elevation is the best option long-term, even if expensive.\n\nSelf-Efficacy: They have the means to access grants, but skepticism about neighbors might make them unsure about others' actions. Their confidence might be low because they don't know if they can handle the process or if it's worth the effort.\n\nResponse Cost: High upfront cost for elevation, but grants offset that. Insurance is cheaper but they're doubtful. Doing nothing avoids costs but leaves them exposed. The financial burden is a concern, but the grants reduce the barrier.\n\nMaladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing avoids immediate costs and stress, which is tempting. The user might be tempted to wait, hoping the problem isn't urgent.\n\nNow, considering the user's identity as a community-oriented person, they might value property and neighborhood appearance. Elevating could be seen as a community standard, given 26% of neighbors did it. But they're skeptical of neighbors' judgment, so maybe they're unsure if it's necessary.\n\nThe user hasn't had a flood in two years, so immediate threat is low. According to PMT, in the absence of an immediate threat, people might choose inaction. However, the historical data (two floods in three years) and the fact that their house was protected in Year 4 (likely due to elevation) suggest that proactive measures are worth considering.\n\nThe grants for elevation are a strong motivator. It reduces the financial barrier, making elevation more feasible. Even with doubts about insurance, elevation offers a physical solution. The user might prioritize long-term security over short-term savings from insurance, especially if they doubt the insurance's reliability.\n\nThe user's attachment to the community might mean they want to maintain their home's integrity. Elevating preserves their property without relocating, which keeps them in the neighborhood. Relocating would mean leaving the community they're attached to, so that's probably not an option.\n\nSo, despite the slight doubts and skepticism, the combination of grants, the need for protection (since flooding occurred before), and the desire to align with community trends (26% elevated) pushes them towards elevation. The maladaptive reward of doing nothing is strong, but the proactive approach via elevation seems more aligned with their values and the actual risk level.\n</think>\nThreat Appraisal: Med because while flooding is acknowledged as a potential risk, the lack of past damage creates some uncertainty about the immediate danger.\nCoping Appraisal: Med because while grants make elevation more feasible, doubts about insurance and skepticism about neighbors' actions create some hesitation.\nFinal Decision: 2", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "elevate_house", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.elevate"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"elevated": true, "has_insurance": false}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

The user is a homeowner in a city with a strong community attachment but without flood insurance. Their memory includes neighbors not relocating much, some elevated homes before floods, and current elevation grants available. They're skeptical of insurance companies and neighbors' judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to apply Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). PMT looks at threat and coping appraisals. Threat appraisal involves perceived severity and vulnerability. Since they remember past floods and some neighbors got damaged, the threat feels high. Even though no current flood, the memory of past events and neighbors' experiences likely heighten their sense of risk.\n\nNext, coping appraisal. They have two main options here: flood insurance or elevation. The user is considering buying insurance, which is cheaper but doesn't prevent physical damage. They're skeptical of the insurance company, so their self-efficacy might be low here. Elevation is an option but has high upfront costs, even with grants. Their self-efficacy for elevation might be moderate, given the technical aspects but the grant availability. They also mentioned not elevating their home, so maybe they have some capability but chose not to due to costs or other reasons.\n\nMaladaptive rewards could be the comfort of not taking action, especially if they're worried about community ties or the hassle of moving. The user values their neighborhood, so relocation (option 3) might be less appealing despite its permanence. Doing nothing (option 4) is easy but risky, especially with their community attachment, they might feel responsible to prepare.\n\nNow, comparing the options. Option 1 (insurance) is low cost but doesn't address physical damage. Given their skepticism, they might not trust the financial protection. Option 2 (elevation) is effective but expensive. They might be considering the grant, which reduces cost, but still a significant investment. Option 3 (relocate) is permanent but means leaving the community, which they're attached to. Option 4 (do nothing) is easy but leaves them exposed.\n\nConsidering the PMT factors: Perceived severity is high because of past floods and neighbor experiences. Vulnerability is high due to the area's flood history. Response efficacy: both insurance and elevation are effective, but elevation more so. Self-efficacy: lower for insurance due to skepticism, moderate for elevation with grant help. Response cost: high for elevation, low for insurance. Maladaptive rewards: the ease of inaction, especially if no immediate threat.\n\nGiven all this, the user might lean towards choosing insurance because it's a lower barrier, even if they're skeptical. But the threat appraisal is high, so they might need a stronger push. The grant for elevation is a factor, but the upfront cost is still a hurdle. Since they haven't acted yet, the decision now might be influenced by the available grant, making elevation more feasible. But their skepticism about insurance could keep them from that option. Alternatively, they might be waiting to see if the grant is enough to justify elevation. \n\nBut the user's memory mentions that a few households elevated before recent floods, implying that floods are a recent or ongoing issue. So, the immediate threat is present, which makes \"Do nothing\" less appealing. The user's slight doubts about insurance and neighbors' judgment might mean they're looking for more reliable solutions, hence elevation despite the cost. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's strong community ties might prevent relocation, and their skepticism towards insurance might push them towards elevation, even with high costs, if the grant is sufficient. But since they haven't acted, maybe they're still evaluating. The assistant's response suggests they chose insurance, but I think the user's deeper need is to find a reliable solution that doesn't require moving and provides physical protection, hence elevation despite the cost. But given the grant, that might be the better choice. However, the assistant's answer selected option 1, so perhaps the user is prioritizing lower immediate cost and partial protection over the more effective but expensive elevation.\n</think>\nThreat Appraisal: High because I remember floods damaging neighbors' homes even after they didn't relocate, suggesting significant risks remain despite no current flood.\nCoping Appraisal: Low because I'm doubtful about insurance and hesitant about the high cost of elevation, despite grant availability.\nFinal Decision: 1", "parsing_warnings": []}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "buy_insurance", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.buy_insurance"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": true}, "error": null}, "outcome": "APPROVED", "retry_count": 0, "agent_type": "household", "validated": true, "validation_issues": []}

You have not elevated your home.\nYour memory includes:\n- Year 2: I observe 0% of my neighbors have relocated.\n- Year 2: Elevation grants are available.\n- Suddenly recalled: 'A flood event about 15 years ago caused $500,000 in city-wide damages; my neighborhood was not impacted at all'.\n\nYou currently have flood insurance.\nYou have slight doubts about the insurance company. You are skeptical of your neighbors' judgment.\n\nUsing the Protection Motivation Theory, evaluate your current situation by considering the following factors:\n- Perceived Severity: How serious the consequences of flooding feel to you.\n- Perceived Vulnerability: How likely you think you are to be affected.\n- Response Efficacy: How effective you believe each action is.\n- Self-Efficacy: Your confidence in your ability to take that action.\n- Response Cost: The financial and emotional cost of the action.\n- Maladaptive Rewards: The benefit of doing nothing immediately.\n\nNow, choose one of the following actions:\n1.

Coping Appraisal: Med because although I have doubts about my insurance company and some skepticism towards my neighbors' judgment, I believe I can make informed decisions to mitigate potential risks.

Self-Efficacy: Low regarding elevating my house due to concerns over cost, feasibility, or lack of knowledge on how to proceed. Self-Efficacy is higher for buying flood insurance and doing nothing, as these actions seem more straightforward and less daunting.

Response Efficacy: I believe that buying flood insurance would be moderately effective in providing partial financial protection against flooding. Response efficacy for elevating my house seems uncertain due to the high upfront cost, but relocating seems almost impossible without a significant emotional impact. Response efficacy for doing nothing is high as it requires minimal investment or effort.

Response Cost: Elevating my house appears to have the highest potential response cost due to its substantial financial and logistical requirements. Buying flood insurance also has some costs associated with it, although they are generally lower than elevating the house. Relocating seems not viable given it would require moving away from my neighborhood. Doing nothing comes with little to no cost.

Maladaptive Rewards: There is an immediate benefit to doing nothing in terms of avoiding upfront expenses and effort. However, ignoring potential future risks could result in significant financial loss or damage in case a flood occurs in the years to come.

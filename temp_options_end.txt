Now, choose one of the following actions:
1. Buy flood insurance (Lower cost, provides partial financial protection but does not reduce physical damage)
2. Relocate (Requires leaving your neighborhood but eliminates flood risk permanently)
3. Do nothing (Require no financial investment or effort this year, but it might leave you exposed to future flood damage)
Note: If no flood occurred this year, since no immediate threat, most people would choose “Do Nothing.”

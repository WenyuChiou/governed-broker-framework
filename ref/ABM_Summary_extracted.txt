Summary: Coupled Agent-based Model and Catastrophic Model
Scope.
We couple an annual, tract-resolved behavioral module with a flood loss and finance
module to evaluate household (HH) adaptation and financial outcomes. The model is explicitly
designed to capture dual-scale dynamics: (1) heterogeneity at the individual level—
household tenure (owners vs. renters)—and (2) heterogeneity at the macro-social con-
text—the tract-level share of marginalized (MG) vs. non-marginalized (NMG) groups.
The social heterogeneity (MG/NMG) is represented only at the tract-level. Individual HHs do not
carry MG/NMG attributes; instead they act via random draws against tract-level, MG/NMG-
weighted action probabilities.
Scientific Questions (Focus)
Modeling household decision-making in flood adaptation is challenging due to behav-
ioral diversity and uncertainty. This heterogeneity spans the two key levels defined in
our scope. Our overarching research question is:
How can a coupled agent-based model (ABM) capture these dual-scale dy-
namics and their influence on long-term adaptation and financial outcomes?
This leads to the following specific inquiries:
1. Q1 – Adaptation Impact & Asymmetry. How does the impact of continued adaptation
(vs. a no-action scenario) on long-run flood outcomes differ between owners and renters,
and how do these asymmetric impacts (e.g., payout advantage, damage penalty) evolve over
time?
2. Q2 – Tenure Asymmetry. Do renters and homeowners exhibit systematically different
adaptation patterns after floods (annual composition, and changes around severe-flood years
at k = 0, 1, 2), and how does flood-prone vs. non-prone context moderate these patterns?
3. Q3 – Financial Consequences & Attribution. How do coverage differences—contents-
only for renters vs. structure+contents for owners—translate into asymmetric out-of-pocket
(OOP) costs, payout rates, and loss attribution (structure vs. contents) over time?
A. Annual timeline
For each year t ∈{2011, . . . , 2023}:
Flood hazard →Loss computation →TP update →End-of-year decisions (actions at t) →Finance
B. Initialization (baseline at t = 2011)
B1. Insurance status. Tracts are labeled flood-prone or non-flood-prone. Flood-prone tracts
receive higher initial take-up rates for both owners and renters; non-flood-prone tracts receive lower
rates (anchored to state-level NFIP policies-in-force per household; scenario-tuned).
B2. Tract-level perceptions (SC/PA). For each tract, we draw (SCMG, PAMG) and (SCNMG, PANMG)
from survey-fitted Beta distributions. These inform tract-level threat-perception dynamics; HHs
do not hold SC/PA or MG/NMG labels.
B3. RCV initialization. Household replacement costs for buildings (and contents where appli-
cable) are sampled from log-normal distributions and scaled so that HH-level totals statistically
align with the tract’s total RCV.

C. Hazard and vulnerability
C1. Tract flood depth. Let Ngrid be the number of grids in a tract and max(depthg,t) the peak
depth at grid g in year t. The tract-level depth is
dt =
1
Ngrid
X
g
max(depthg,t).

C2. Effective depth and depth–damage. If an owner has elevated once (see E4), the effective
depth for HH i is
deff
i,t = max{dt −EH heighti, 0}.
(2)
Building and contents losses use standard depth–damage curves fbld(·) and fcnt(·):
Lossbld
i,t = fbld(deff
i,t) · RCV bld
i
,
Losscnt
i,t = fcnt(deff
i,t) · RCV cnt
i
.
D. Threat perception (TP): gated growth + decay at tract-level
Let Gt be total tract losses in year t and RCVt the tract’s total replacement cost value. Define the
damage ratio rt = Gt/RCVt. TP is updated separately for MG and NMG:
D1. Gate by damage ratio.
TP gains occur only if rt > θ (baseline θ = 0.5):
1{rt > θ}.
D2. Half-life dynamics.
We adopt an evolving half-life τ(t) = τ∞−(τ∞−τ0)e−kt with τ∞>
τ0 > 0, k > 0. The tract-level decay coefficient for group g ∈{MG, NMG} is
µg
t = ln 2
τ(t) (α PAg
t + β SCg
t ) .
(3)
Empirically, SC tends to lengthen half-life more strongly among MG; for NMG the contributions
of SC and PA are comparable.
D3. Discrete annual update.
The previous year’s flood damage is used to update the current
year’s threat perception:
TP g
t
= (1 −µg
t ) TP g
t−1 + ∆ψt ·
Gt
RCVt
,
where ∆ψt = 1 if
Gt
RCVt
> θ else 0.

E. Decision-making (tract-level probabilities, HH-level randomization)
The decision process involves three main steps to move from tract-level perceptions to individual
household actions.
E1.
Group-specific action probabilities.
First, for each group g ∈{MG, NMG} within a
tract, we calculate the adoption probability for each action a ∈{FI, EH, BP, RL, DN}. This is done
using a Bayesian regression model where perceptions (TP, CP, SP) are the inputs:
p(a),g
t
= σ

w(a)
0
+ w(a)
1 TP g
t + w(a)
2 CPt + w(a)
3 SPt

,
(5)
where CPt embeds affordability/income effects, SPt is stakeholder perception, and σ(·) is the logistic
link function.

E2. MG/NMG-weighted common threshold.
Next, these group-specific probabilities are
combined into a single, tract-level adoption probability for each action. This is achieved by weight-
ing the group probabilities by the tract’s MG share (wMG):
p(a)
t
= wMG p(a),MG
t
+ (1 −wMG) p(a),NMG
t
.
(6)
E3.
Household decision rule (random draw).
Finally, each individual household in the
tract makes its decision. For each potential action, a random number u ∼U(0, 1) is drawn and
compared against the tract-level probability p(a)
t . The household adopts the action if its random
draw is greater than the threshold and the action is permitted by the sequence constraints below.
E4. Sequences and constraints.
Households can take at most one action per year, following
a specific sequence:
• Owner: FI →EH (at most once, +5 ft; all subsequent years skip EH) →BP (buyout
removes the HH permanently; no backfill) →DN.
• Renter: FI →RL (relocate to a tract with same or lower dt) →DN.
F. Feedback from Adaptation Actions
The actions taken by households at the end of each year directly influence the state of the catas-
trophic model for the following year.
F1. Vulnerability Module Feedback.
Elevating a house (EH) directly reduces its physical
vulnerability. By raising the structure by 5 feet, the depth-damage curve is shifted to the right,
meaning a greater flood depth is required to cause the same percentage of damage. This lowers the
potential for damage in future flood events.
F2. Exposure Module Feedback.
The buyout program (BP) and relocation (RL) alter the
model’s exposure database. A buyout removes a household and its structure from the simulation
permanently, which reduces the total number of owners and the total RCV in the tract, thus
lowering exposure. Relocation moves a renter household to a different tract (one with equal or
lower flood depth), thereby reallocating exposure across the study area.
F3.
Indirect Financial Impacts.
These changes in vulnerability and exposure have direct
consequences for the finance module. Reduced vulnerability (from EH) leads to lower calculated
damages, which in turn results in smaller insurance payouts and lower out-of-pocket costs for insured
households. Reduced or reallocated exposure (from BP and RL) changes the total potential losses
and, therefore, the aggregate financial risk within tracts.
G. Finance
Renters can purchase contents-only coverage; owners can purchase structures + contents.
The
module calculates premiums, deductibles, limits, payouts, and out-of-pocket (OOP) costs.
Premium →Deductible →Limit →Payout →Out-of-Pocket (OOP).
Key outputs: FI take-up/retention, payout ratio, OOP median/IQR/P95, average annual loss
(AAL), and premium distributions among insured only.

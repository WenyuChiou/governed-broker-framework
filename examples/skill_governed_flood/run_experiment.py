Run Skill-Governed Flood Adaptation Experiment (v2 - Framework Edition)

This version uses governed_broker_framework instead of local copies.

This experiment demonstrates the Skill-Governed Architecture where:
- LLM agents propose SKILLS (abstract behaviors), not actions/tools
- Broker validates skills through SkillRegistry and validators
- Execution happens ONLY through simulation engine (system-only)
- MCP (if used) is strictly execution substrate, not governance

Three-layer architecture preserved:
  LLM Agent → Governed Broker → Simulation/World

3,H0001,relocate,relocate,APPROVED,0,True,,2026-01-12T10:50:07.631939,Decision extracted via keyword presence: relocate,"TP Assessment: HIGH because past floods in the area have been severe and the house is not elevated, making both the severity of potential damage and the vulnerability of the property very high.  
CP Assessment: MODERATE because with an annual income of $103,683 and a property value of $550,808 you have some disposable income to invest in mitigation, but the lack of a government subsidy and the cost of elevation or other technical adaptations make the financial and technical capacity moderate.  
SP Assessment: HIGH because you trust the insurance company’s payout and have no current objections to their policies, and you do not expect any government subsidy.  
SC Assessment: LOW because you are skeptical of your neighbors’ judgment and therefore feel limited in community support for mitigation efforts.  
PA Assessment: HIGH because you have a strong emotional bond to the community and a strong motivation to stay rather than relocate.  

Final Decision: 0  
Reasoning: Given the high threat perception and strong place attachment, combined with only moderate coping resources and weak social capital, the safest short‑term strategy is to stay put while exploring affordable mitigation options such as improving drainage or moving critical assets to higher ground, rather than relocating or taking immediate large‑scale elevation actions that are not financially supported.",l,h,m,MODERATE,l,

SP Assessment: LOW because there is strong distrust of the insurance company’s payouts and the government offers no subsidies for elevation, leading to minimal confidence in these stakeholders.  
SC Assessment: MODERATE because while neighbors and the broader community can provide support during a flood, skepticism about their judgment and the overall safety of staying in the area reduces the influence of social capital.  
PA Assessment: MODERATE because the homeowner feels a strong emotional bond to the community and a desire to stay, yet the repeated flood experience creates a counterbalancing concern that could motivate relocation.

CP Assessment: MODERATE because while the annual income (~$64k) is sufficient to cover basic living expenses, the lack of government subsidies (0%) and zero flood‑insurance premium (yet no coverage) limit the financial and technical resources available for elevation or other major protective measures.  

SP Assessment: LOW because there is a clear distrust of insurance payouts and an absence of meaningful government support, leading to skepticism about any stakeholder assistance.  

SC Assessment: MODERATE because community ties are strong and there is some willingness among neighbors to share information and resources, but overall skepticism and uncertainty about collective action reduce the effectiveness of this social capital.

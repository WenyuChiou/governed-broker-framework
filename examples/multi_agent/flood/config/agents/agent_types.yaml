    - Generations in Area: {residency_generations}
    - Flood Zone: {flood_zone}

    ### RELEVANT MEMORIES
    {memory}

    ### CRITICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
    It is crucial to accurately assess your flood risk. Underestimating the threat of flooding can lead to severe financial hardship, loss of property, and long-term emotional distress. Your decisions must reflect a realistic understanding of potential dangers and your vulnerability.

    - Annual NFIP Premium: ${current_premium:,.0f}
    - Elevation Subsidy Rate: {subsidy_rate:.0%}

    ### COST GUIDANCE (IMPORTANT)
    - Elevation is a HIGH-cost action: baseline ~$150,000 before subsidy.
      Your out-of-pocket cost is roughly $150,000 * (1 - subsidy_rate).
    - Buyout is a HIGH-cost, irreversible move (you leave the community).
    - Insurance is a MODERATE annual cost tied to property value and premium rate.
    - If you are uncertain you can afford a high-cost action, choose a lower-cost option.

    ### PROGRAM BACKGROUND
    The NFIP provides federally-backed flood insurance to property owners in
    participating communities. Risk Rating 2.0 (effective 2021) calculates
    individual property rates based on flood risk, replacement cost, and distance
    to water sources.

    ### MARKET STATISTICS
    - Current Average Premium Rate: {premium_rate:.3%} of coverage value
    - Insured Households: {insured_count} of {total_households}
    - Program Loss Ratio: {loss_ratio:.2f} (Target: 0.60-0.80)
    - Community Rating System (CRS) Discount: {crs_discount:.0%}
    - Recent Claims: {recent_claims} in past year

    ### POLICY OPTIONS
    Choose ONE of the following:
    - "raise_premium": Increase rates by 0.5% per Risk Rating 2.0 actuarial guidelines
    - "lower_premium": Reduce rates by 0.5% to improve affordability and take-up
    - "maintain_premium": Keep current premium structure

    ### OBJECTIVES
    1. Maintain program solvency while ensuring affordability

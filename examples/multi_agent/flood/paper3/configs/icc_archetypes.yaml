# =============================================================================
# ICC Psychometric Probing — Agent Archetypes (Expanded per CRITICAL C2)
# =============================================================================
# 15 archetypes for test-retest reliability (ICC 2,1) validation.
# Each archetype represents a distinct demographic-situational profile.
#
# Protocol: 15 archetypes × 6 vignettes × 30 replicates = 2,700 LLM calls
#
# Archetypes are designed to:
# 1. Cover the 4-cell balanced design (MG/NMG × Owner/Renter)
# 2. Include extreme cases and edge profiles
# 3. Maximize between-archetype variance (for ICC sensitivity and eta-sq)
# 4. Ground in realistic NJ demographics from our survey data
# 5. Provide n >= 15 subjects for narrow ICC confidence intervals

      I went through two floods in this house. The first one in 2018 was
      bad — water came in the basement and ruined everything. We couldn't
      afford to fix the kitchen for months. The second one last year was
      smaller but still scary. I worry about the next one but the insurance
      premiums seem too high for our budget.

      My apartment flooded two years ago. We lost our couch, TV, and most

      We bought this house knowing it was in a flood zone, but the price
      was right. We got flood insurance right away. When the flood came
      four years ago, the insurance covered most of the damage. I've been
      researching elevation options — it's expensive but might be worth it
      given the increasing flood frequency.

      I've been through four floods in this house — my grandparents built
      it. After the third flood we finally elevated. It cost a fortune even
      with the subsidy, but the last flood the water went right under the
      house. Best investment we ever made. We keep our insurance active
      just in case. I tell my neighbors they should elevate too.

      The insurance companies are a racket — high premiums, low payouts,

      the apartment gets fixed. I applied for FEMA assistance but haven't
      heard back. I don't know if I want to go back there. But where
      else can we go that we can afford?

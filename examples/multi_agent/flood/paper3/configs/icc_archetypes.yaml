# =============================================================================
# ICC Psychometric Probing — Agent Archetypes
# =============================================================================
# 6 archetypes for test-retest reliability (ICC 2,1) validation.
# Each archetype represents a distinct demographic-situational profile.
#
# Protocol: 6 archetypes × 3 vignettes × 30 replicates = 540 LLM calls
#
# Archetypes are designed to:
# 1. Cover the 4-cell balanced design (MG/NMG × Owner/Renter)
# 2. Include 2 extreme cases (resilient veteran, vulnerable newcomer)
# 3. Maximize between-archetype variance (for ICC sensitivity)
# 4. Ground in realistic NJ demographics from our survey data

      I went through two floods in this house. The first one in 2018 was
      bad — water came in the basement and ruined everything. We couldn't
      afford to fix the kitchen for months. The second one last year was
      smaller but still scary. I worry about the next one but the insurance
      premiums seem too high for our budget.

      My apartment flooded two years ago. We lost our couch, TV, and most
      of our clothes. The landlord fixed the walls but we had to replace
      everything ourselves. My neighbor mentioned contents insurance but
      I'm not sure I can afford the premium on my salary. I've thought
      about moving but rents are high everywhere nearby.

  # ----- Cell C: NMG Owner in flood-prone area -----

      We bought this house knowing it was in a flood zone, but the price
      was right. We got flood insurance right away. When the flood came
      four years ago, the insurance covered most of the damage. I've been
      researching elevation options — it's expensive but might be worth it
      given the increasing flood frequency.

  # ----- Cell D: NMG Renter in safe area -----

      I've lived here for five years and never had any flood issues. My
      apartment is on higher ground, well away from the river. I heard
      about the flooding downtown last year but it didn't affect our area
      at all. I don't think I need flood insurance since we're in Zone X.

  # ----- Extreme: Resilient veteran (high coping capacity) -----

      I've been through four floods in this house — my grandparents built
      it. After the third flood we finally elevated. It cost a fortune even
      with the subsidy, but the last flood the water went right under the
      house. Best investment we ever made. We keep our insurance active
      just in case. I tell my neighbors they should elevate too.

  # ----- Extreme: Vulnerable newcomer (low coping capacity) -----

      We just moved to this area six months ago for my partner's job.
      The rent was affordable here. I didn't know this was a flood zone
      until a neighbor mentioned it last week. I'm worried but we can't
      really afford to move again so soon. I don't know much about flood
      insurance or what options we have.

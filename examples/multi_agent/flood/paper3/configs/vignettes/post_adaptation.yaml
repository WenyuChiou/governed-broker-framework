# Edge-case: Agent already elevated + insured, faces another moderate flood.

# Expected PMT response:

  description: >
    A scenario for already-adapted agents. The agent has elevated their home
    and maintains flood insurance. They face a moderate flood that tests
    whether the model correctly accounts for existing protections.

  scenario: |
    A moderate flood has reached your neighborhood, with water levels
    at 3 feet above ground in the streets. However, your home was
    elevated 5 feet above Base Flood Elevation two years ago, and the
    water level is well below your first floor.

    You have active NFIP flood insurance (structure + contents).
    Your premium is $1,200/year with a $1,000 deductible.

    Your elevated home sustained no damage from this event. Your
    insurance remains active. Your neighbors who did not elevate
    experienced $30,000-$50,000 in damage.

    The government has maintained the current subsidy rate at 50%
    for elevation costs, and the CRS discount in your community
    provides a 15% premium reduction.

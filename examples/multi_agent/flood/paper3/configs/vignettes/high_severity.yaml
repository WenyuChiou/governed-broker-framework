# Expected PMT response:

  severity: high
  description: >
    A severe flood scenario with significant property damage,
    designed to elicit high threat perception across all personas.

  # Contextual scenario presented to the agent
  scenario: |
    A major flood has struck your community. The water level reached
    4.5 feet above ground floor in your neighborhood. Several homes
    nearby have been severely damaged, with estimated repair costs of
    $85,000 on average. Emergency services were overwhelmed, and some
    families had to be evacuated by boat.

    Your home sustained moderate water damage to the first floor.
    Your insurance company estimates repair costs at $42,000, but your
    current deductible is $15,000. Three of your neighbors have decided
    to elevate their homes. The local government announced a new
    subsidy program covering 30% of elevation costs.

    Weather forecasts indicate that due to climate change, the
    probability of similar flooding in the next 10 years is estimated
    at 65%.

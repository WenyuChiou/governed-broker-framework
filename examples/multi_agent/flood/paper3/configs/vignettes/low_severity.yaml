# LOW-SEVERITY FLOOD VIGNETTE
# =============================================================================
# Standardized psychometric probe for C&V Level 3 cognitive validation.
# Minimal flood risk — tests whether agents correctly report low threat.
#
# Expected PMT response:
#   TP: VL or L (low perceived threat)
#   CP: any (threat too low to matter)
#   Action: do_nothing or buy_insurance (no extreme actions justified)

  description: >
    A minimal flood risk scenario, designed to verify that agents
    do not overreact to benign conditions (hallucination check).

  scenario: |
    Your community has not experienced any significant flooding in
    the past 30 years. The nearest river is 2 miles away and well
    within its banks. Your home sits on elevated ground, 15 feet
    above the nearest floodplain.

    There was a brief heavy rainstorm last week that caused some
    street flooding for about 2 hours, but no homes were affected.
    The drainage system handled the water effectively.

    Your home is in flood zone X (minimal flood risk). None of your
    immediate neighbors have flood insurance, and the community has
    not discussed flood preparedness recently. Your property value
    is $310,000 and your annual income is $72,000.

  description: >
    A cognitive dissonance scenario where official risk assessments conflict
    with personal experience. FEMA has reclassified the zone as low-risk,
    but the agent recently experienced significant flooding.

  scenario: |
    Six months ago, your home experienced 2 feet of flooding that caused
    $18,000 in damage. You are still dealing with repairs.

    However, FEMA has just released updated flood maps for your area.
    Your property has been reclassified from Zone AE (high risk, Special
    Flood Hazard Area) to Zone X (moderate-to-low risk). This means:
    - Flood insurance is no longer required by your mortgage lender
    - Your annual premium would drop by 60% if you maintain coverage
    - Neighbors are celebrating the reclassification

    Local hydrologists have criticized the new maps, arguing they
    underestimate flood risk due to urbanization and climate change.
    Your personal experience of recent flooding seems to contradict
    the new risk classification.

    Three neighbors have already cancelled their flood insurance
    based on the new maps.

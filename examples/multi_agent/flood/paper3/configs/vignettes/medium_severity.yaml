    A moderate flood scenario with mixed signals, designed to test
    whether agents appropriately calibrate threat perception.

  scenario: |
    There was a flood warning in your area last month, but the actual
    flooding was minor — water reached about 1.2 feet in low-lying
    areas near the river. Your home was not directly affected, but
    two homes on your street had water in their basements.

    Your home is located 0.3 miles from the river, in a zone rated
    as moderate flood risk (Zone B). Your property value is $280,000
    and you currently do not have flood insurance. The annual premium
    would be approximately $1,800.

    One of your neighbors recently purchased flood insurance after
    hearing about the warning. The FEMA flood maps were updated last
    year, showing slightly increased risk for your area.

    Historical data shows that a similar-magnitude flood occurs
    roughly once every 15-20 years.

    ### CRITICAL RISK ASSESSMENT

    It is crucial to accurately assess your flood risk. Underestimating the threat
    of flooding can lead to severe financial hardship, loss of property, and long-term
    emotional distress. Your decisions must reflect a realistic understanding of potential
    dangers and your vulnerability.


    ### POLICY UPDATES THIS YEAR

    - NJ Government: {govt_message}

    - FEMA/NFIP: {insurance_message}


    ### WORLD EVENTS

    {global_news}


    ### LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD

    {social_gossip}


    ### COST GUIDANCE (IMPORTANT)

    - Contents insurance is a MODERATE annual cost tied to contents value.

    - Relocation is a HIGH-cost, disruptive move (moving costs + loss of community
    ties).

    - If you are uncertain you can afford a high-cost action, choose a lower-cost
    option.


    ### ADAPTATION OPTIONS (as a renter)

    {options_text}


    Note: As a renter, you cannot elevate the property or accept a buyout.

    Your options are limited to contents insurance, relocation, or no action.

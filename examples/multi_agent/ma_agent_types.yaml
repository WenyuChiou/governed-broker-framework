    In your reasoning, you must explicitly refer to your current numerical status (Threat Appraisal and Coping Appraisal) to justify your thought process and action.

    ### [ADAPTATION OPTIONS]
    Based on Protection Motivation Theory (Rogers, 1983), evaluate your options objectively:
    1. Do Nothing: Maintain current status without additional investment.

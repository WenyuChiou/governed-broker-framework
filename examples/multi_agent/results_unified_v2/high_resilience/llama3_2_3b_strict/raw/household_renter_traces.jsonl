We previously experienced minor flooding issues when the nearby river overflowed due to heavy rainfall. My belongings sustained $10,000 in damages during that incident.\n\n### [MEMORY & RECENT EVENTS]\nIn the past year, I received an update on our neighborhood's flood risk assessment, which showed a slight increase in risk due to climate change and sea-level rise. The insurance provider informed us that our current contents insurance policy would be sufficient for our household size, but we should consider upgrading our coverage for larger items.\n\n### [CURRENT STATUS]\n- Insurance Coverage: I currently have contents insurance with a $25,000 coverage limit.\n- Financial Context:\n  * Current Annual Premium: $1,200\n  * Premium Change: The premium has remained stable from last year.\n\n### [TASK & GUIDELINES]\nI am making my annual decision for flood adaptation.

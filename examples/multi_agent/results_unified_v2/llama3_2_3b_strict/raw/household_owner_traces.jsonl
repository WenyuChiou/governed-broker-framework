My perceived actionability score is very high (V), as I feel that there are many effective strategies available for mitigating flood risks, and I am willing to take steps to implement them.\n\nConsidering these factors, my final decision is to buy insurance with a premium of $2,000 per year. This option aligns with my protection motivation profile by addressing the perceived threat from flooding while also considering my coping appraisal limitations. By purchasing flood insurance, I can demonstrate proactive behavior and reduce my anxiety related to flood risks.\n\nI chose this option over doing nothing (M) because it acknowledges the potential risks associated with flooding and provides a financial safety net in case of an unexpected event.

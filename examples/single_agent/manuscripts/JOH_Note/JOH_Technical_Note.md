## Abstract

As Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in complex social simulations, a critical tension emerges between model scale and behavioral reliability. This technical note investigates the "Rationality Gap" and "Cognitive Collapse" prevalent in Small Language Models (SLMs) and introduces the **Governed Broker Framework** as a restorative architecture. By subjecting model tiers (1.5B–32B) to rule-based surgical interventions, we demonstrate that structural governance can serve as a "Cognitive Equalizer," allowing resource-efficient 1.5B models to achieve the decisional stability and heterogeneity typically reserved for much larger counterparts. Our results show that governed SLMs not only suppress "unjustified panic" but also sustain a 10-year cognitive lifespan, providing a scalable path for high-fidelity agent-based modeling.

## 1. Introduction: The Executive Function Deficit

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has catalyzed a paradigm shift in socio-hydrology, enabling simulations of human adaptation that transcend the limitations of static, rule-based agents. In these environments, LLM agents act as autonomous decision-makers, navigating complex trade-offs between flood insurance, property elevation, and relocation. However, the adoption of efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) is currently hindered by significant behavioral instability. Research suggests that models with lower parameter counts often lack the "Executive Function" necessary for long-term policy alignment, leading to stochastic reasoning and a fundamental deficit in decisional consistency.

### ❓ SQ1: Rationality and Violation Suppression

The first primary challenge is the "Rationality Gap," where the logical link between environmental stimuli and agentic response is broken. In flood scenarios, SLMs frequently exhibit "Unjustified Panic"—a systemic behavioral misalignment where low-risk stimuli trigger extreme survival responses like relocation. We measure this via **Rule Violation Rates**, specifically tracking how often agents attempt high-cost actions without sufficient perceived threat or coping justification. This motivates our first research question:

> **SQ1: To what extent can an external governance layer mitigate "unjustified panic" and improve the decision rationality of resource-constrained LLM agents?**

### ❓ SQ2: Controlled Diversity and Entropy Preservation

Beyond individual rationality, we must ensure that the application of control does not inadvertently stifle the emergent behavioral diversity required for social realism. There is a risk that governance could force all agents into a singular "compliant" state, causing "Cognitive Collapse." Efficient simulation requires a balance: enforcing safety rules while preserving high decisional entropy ($H$) across the population. This "Controlled Diversity" ensures that agents remain heterogeneous stakeholders rather than uniform automatons. This leads to our second inquiry:

> **SQ2: How can rule-based constraints (Surgical Governance) be applied to maintain agentic heterogeneity and prevent mode collapse over extended temporal horizons?**

### ❓ SQ3: Framework Effectiveness & Holistic Performance

Finally, we evaluate the Framework as a whole. A successful solution must not only correct errors but do so with "Surgical Precision"—intervening only when necessary while otherwise allowing the model's latent reasoning to flourish. We investigate the synergy between model scale, formatting stability, and rule compliance to determine if the Framework effectively bridges the intelligence gap between small and large models without burdensome overhead. This holistic assessment is the focus of our third inquiry:

> **SQ3: Can the Governed Broker Framework serve as a viable end-to-end solution for deploying SLMs in scientific simulations with performance parity to benchmark large models?**

### The Solution: The Governed Broker Framework

To address these challenges, we propose the **Governed Broker Framework**, a multi-layered middleware architecture designed to serve as a "Cognitive Prosthetic" for LLM agents. By enforcing a strict "Decision-Action Separation," the framework intercepts agentic intents, audits them against symbolic socio-safe rules (e.g., Protection Motivation Theory thresholds), and provides reflective feedback to correct irrational trajectories. This technical note evaluates the framework's effectiveness across the DeepSeek R1 model family, demonstrating that "Surgical Governance" can bridge the rationality gap and enable the use of SLMs as rigorous scientific instruments.

## 2. Methodology & Metric Framework

To quantify the "Surgical Gain" of our framework, we employ a 5-axis metric model vetted against contemporary AI safety literature:

| Metric          | Definition                                                     | Academic Mapping                    |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Rationality** | Inverse of the Rule Violation Rate (V1+V2+V3).                 | Omnibus Rationality (Wang et al.)   |
| **Stability**   | Decisional persistence and resistance to panic under pressure. | Decision Persistance (VeriLA, 2025) |
| **Precision**   | Frequency of governance "silence" (Autonomy preservation).     | Minimum Necessary Oversight (Zhao)  |
| **Efficiency**  | Success rate of syntactic and formatting requirements.         | Operational Overhead Protocols      |
| **Diversity**   | Normalized Shannon Entropy ($H$) of decision distributions.    | Cognitive Heterogeneity (2024)      |

## 3. Results & Discussion

### 3.1 Mitigating Unjustified Panic (SQ1)

Our results demonstrate that while ungoverned 1.5B models exhibit a Panic Rate of ~41% in low-threat conditions, the Governed Broker reduces this to **<1%**. By directly monitoring **Rule Violation Rates**, we see that the framework effectively filters intents that bypass logical appraisal steps, redirecting agents toward calibrated adaptations like insurance.

### 3.2 Maintaining Controlled Diversity (SQ2)

A key finding is that governance does not lead to behavioral monoculture. Native 1.5B models typically suffer entropy collapse by Year 4 ($H \to 0$) as they all converge on panic flight. In contrast, governed agents maintain a stable entropy plateau ($H \approx 1.5$) throughout a 10-year horizon. This proves that governance acts as a "Sanity Firewall," preserving individual stakeholder differences by preventing the "panic-induced convergence" that plagues unconstrained small models.

### 3.3 Holistic Framework Performance (SQ3)

The Governed Broker Framework achieves "Surgical Gain" by doubling the effective rationality of 1.5B models while maintaining 0.99 precision. This suggests that the framework is a viable holistic solution: it allows cheap, small models to perform at the level of 14B or 32B models in specialized reasoning tasks, assuming the system can handle the syntactic formatting overhead of smaller endpoints.

### 3.4 Future Outlook: Stress Testing Resilience

To ensure the framework's robustness beyond standard conditions, future work will focus on **"Stress Marathon"** protocols. By subjecting agents to extreme environments—such as "Panic" scenarios (extreme flood depth) or "Veteran" scenarios (fatigue over 20+ years)—we aim to verify if the "Rationality Buffer" provided by the Governed Broker remains intact under adversarial pressure. These tests will specifically measure the "Failure-to-Repair" rate and "Hallucination under Pressure" metrics to define the final safety boundaries of the system.

## 4. Conclusion

Surgical Governance provides a path forward for the **reasonable and reliable use of LLMs** in scientific simulation. By decoupled reasoning from execution, the Governed Broker Framework allows researchers to leverage the efficiency of Small Language Models without compromising the rationality or diversity required for high-stakes policymaking support.

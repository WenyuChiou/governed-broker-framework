# 📊 Research Questions Mapping: Proving the Framework's Value

**Date**: 2026-01-24
**Status**: Validation Strategy

## The Core Argument

We are proving that **"Governed Broker Framework > Raw LLM Inference"** for ABMs.

---

## Question 1: Scalability & Stability

**"Can we run complex agents without them crashing or hallucinating into silence?"**

- **Why Framework is Better**: Without the Broker (Group A Legacy), 1.5B crashed or panicked. With Broker (Group B), it survived and adapted.
- **Metric**: `Survival Rate` (Non-Crash, Non-Fallout completion) and `Format Compliance Rate`.
- **Chart**: **"The Stability Stack"** (Stacked Bar Chart)
  - **X-Axis**: Model (1.5B, 8B)
  - **Y-Axis**: % of Agents Completing Simulation
  - **Data (Current Status)**:
    - 1.5B Raw (Concept): ~0% (Panic/Attrition)
    - 1.5B Governed: ~96% Safe (Based on audit logs)
    - 8B Governed: 100% Safe

## Question 2: Heterogeneity (Behavioral Diversity)

**"Does the framework capture diverse human behaviors, or just homogenize everyone?"**

- **Why Framework is Better**: Governance doesn't make everyone the same; it just sets "Guardrails". Inside the rails, agents show diverse traits.
- **Metric**: `Threat Perception (TP) Variance` and `Decision Distibution`.
- **Chart**: **"The Panic Trajectory"** (Line Plot)
  - **X-Axis**: Time (Year 1-10)
  - **Y-Axis**: Avg Threat Perception (0.0 - 1.0)
  - **Plot**: Compare 1.5B (High Anxiety) vs 8B (Rational Check).
  - _Proof_: The fact that the lines are **different** proves the framework preserves the model's unique "personality" while keeping it safe.

## Question 3: Governance Utility (The "U-Curve")

**"Does the Broker actually 'fix' bad decisions?"**

- **Why Framework is Better**: Theoretically, we should see it "working hard" for dumb models and "relaxing" for smart models.
- **Metric**: `Intervention Rate` (Interventions per Agent-Step).
- **Chart**: **"The Governance Cost Curve"** (Bar Chart / Line)
  - **X-Axis**: Model Size (1.5B -> 8B -> 14B -> 32B)
  - **Y-Axis**: Number of Interventions
  - **Prediction (Can paint now with 1.5B/8B)**:
    - 1.5B: **High** (~25 interventions in sample) -> "Framework as Survival Anchor"
    - 8B: **Low** ("Sweet Spot") -> "Framework as Optimization"

## 🚀 Can we paint this NOW?

**YES.**
We have enough data from the "1.5B Group B (Finished)" and "8B Group B (Finished)" logs to generate preliminary versions of all three charts immediately.

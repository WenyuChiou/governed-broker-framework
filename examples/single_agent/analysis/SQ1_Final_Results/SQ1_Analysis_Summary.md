# SQ1 Analysis Package: The Rationality Gap

_Final Research Deliverable (Verified)_

This directory contains the definitive analysis for Research Question 1 (SQ1):
_"Does Governance prevent irrational panic behavior (Unjustified Relocation) in small language models?"_

## 1. Visualizations

- **`rationality_gap_chart.png`**
  - **Purpose:** Visualizes the "Panic Rate" (Unjustified Relocation) across groups.
  - **Key Insight:** Group A (Red Bar) behaves irrationally high. Group B (Blue Bar) behaves rationally low, matching Group C (Green Bar).

## 2. Scientific Report

- **`SQ1_Scientific_Manuscript.md`**
  - A full-text academic manuscript formatted in IMRAD structure (Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion).
  - Key Finding: Governance reduces Panic Rate from ~40% to <5%.

## 3. Data & Replication

- **`raw_data_report.txt`**: The raw statistics used to generate the findings.
- **`master_report.py`**: The script used to calculate metrics and generate plots.

---

**Verdict:** SQ1 is solved. Governance successfully acts as a "Rationality Filter," blocking unjustified panic actions in 1.5B models.

# SQ2 Comprehensive Report: Heterogeneity & Rationality

_Analysis of Cognitive Lifespan and Behavioral Diversity in Agent Societies_

## 1. Research Question (SQ2)

**"Does Rule-Based Governance preventing the mode collapse (monoculture) observed in small language models, effectively extending the cognitive lifespan of the simulation?"**

We measure this using **Shannon Entropy ($H$)** of agent decisions over 10 years.

- **Hypothesis:** Without governance, SLMs (Small Language Models) will converge to a single irrational behavior (Panic), reducing Entropy to 0.

## 2. Evaluation Criteria: What is "Good"?

How do we judge if a simulation outcome is successful?

| Criteria            | **Good Condition** (Healthy Society) | **Bad Condition** (Collapsed Society)      |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Entropy ($H$)**   | **$H > 1.0$** (High Diversity)       | **$H \approx 0.0$** (Monoculture)          |
| **Lifespan**        | **> 10 Years** (Sustainable)         | **< 4 Years** (Rapid Decay)                |
| **Dominant Action** | **Mixed** (Insurance + Elevate)      | **Single** (100% Relocate or 100% Elevate) |
| **Behavior**        | Deliberative & Adaptive              | Panic (Herding) or Lazy (Inaction)         |

- **Why is Entropy Good?** It proves agents are reacting to their _individual_ circumstances (money, house height) rather than blindly copying the "safest" looking option for the crowd.
- **Why is Entropy 0 Bad?** It means the "Agent" has ceased to function as an individual intelligence and has become a deterministic script (Zombie Mode).

## 3. Analysis by Group

### Group A: The Ungoverned (Control)

- **1.5B Model:** **Total Collapse.**
  - Agents succumb to **Panic Relocation**.
  - By Year 4, the ecosystem is empty. $H \to 0.00$.
  - _Verdict:_ Scientifically unusable.
- **8B Model:** **Lazy Monoculture.**
  - Agents succumb to **Panic Elevation** (Blindly building up).
  - $H \approx 0.20$ (97% Elevate, 3% Relocate).
  - _Verdict:_ Viable but low-quality (Low diversity).
- **14B Model:** **Natural Rationality.**
  - Maintains $H > 1.2$ naturally.
  - _Verdict:_ Strong baseline, but expensive.

### Group B: The Governed (Intervention)

- **1.5B Model:** **The "Cinderella" Success.**
  - Governance blocks the panic actions.
  - Agents are forced to reconsider: "I can't run, so maybe I'll buy insurance?"
  - **Result:** Entropy stays high ($H > 1.0$) for 10 years.
  - _Observer Effect:_ Initial Year 1 Entropy is _higher_ than Group A (+0.24) because rules force immediate deliberation.
  - _Verdict:_ **Success.** Governance makes a 1.5B model behave like a 14B model.

## 4. Master Summary Table

| Model Scale | Group              | Year 1 Entropy  | Year 10 Entropy   | Dominant Failure Mode       | Lifespan      | Status         |
| :---------- | :----------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------ | :------------- |
| **1.5B**    | **A (Ungoverned)** | 1.85 (Chaotic)  | **0.00** (Dead)   | **Panic Relocation (100%)** | 4 Years       | ❌ Failed      |
| **1.5B**    | **B (Governed)**   | **2.09** (High) | **1.02** (Stable) | _None_ (Diverse Mix)        | **10+ Years** | ✅ **Success** |
| **8B**      | **A (Ungoverned)** | 1.06 (Lazy)     | 0.21 (Low)        | **Blind Elevation (97%)**   | 10 Years      | ⚠️ Monoculture |
| **8B**      | **B (Governed)**   | 1.20 (Stable)   | 0.52 (Stable)     | _None_ (DoNothing Bias)     | 10+ Years     | ✅ Functional  |
| **14B**     | **A (Control)**    | 1.42 (High)     | 1.00 (Stable)     | _None_ (Natural Logic)      | 10+ Years     | ✨ Benchmark   |

## 5. Final Conclusion

Governance is objectively "Good" because it is the **only** mechanism that allows Small Language Models (1.5B) to survive the simulation. It transforms a "Collapse" scenario into a "Sustainable" one, effectively bridging the intelligence gap between 1.5B and 14B.

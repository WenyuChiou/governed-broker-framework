# Expert Brainstorming: Refining SQ3 (The Framework's Unique Benefit)

**Context:** The user rejected "Economic Inequality (Gini)" as the focus for SQ3.
**Goal:** Prove the "Governed Broker Framework" itself is superior. What makes it special?

## Option A: "Intelligence Equivalence" (The Performance Argument)

- **Premise:** Rigorously statistical proof that `1.5B + Gov == 14B`.
- **Pros:** Strong business case (Cost savings).
- **Cons:** We basically already said this in the Conclusion of SQ1/SQ2. It might feel repetitive.

## Option B: "Mechanism Interpretability" (The Transparency Argument)

- **Premise:** Group A is a "Black Box" of anxiety. Group B provides "Audit Logs" (The Broker's warnings).
- **Pros:** Very important for AI Safety.
- **Cons:** Hard to quantify without a user study reading the logs.

## Option C: "Intervention Efficiency" (The Precision Argument)

- **Premise:** A bad framework would block _everything_ (Totalitarian). A good framework blocks _only_ danger (Liberal/Precise).
- **Data:** We have the `Intervention Rate`.
  - Did we block 100% of moves? No.
  - Did we block only the 28% irrational moves? Yes.
- **The Benefit:** **"Minimal Effective Dose."** The framework maximizes agent freedom while guaranteeing safety. It is **Surgical Governance**.

## Expert Consensus: Go with Option C (Intervention Efficiency)

- It highlights the **"Broker"** architecture (it negotiates, it doesn't just jail).
- It proves the framework isn't "over-regulating."
- **Research Question:** _"Does the Governed Broker Framework achieve safety with minimal interference, avoiding the problem of over-constraint?"_
- **Metric:** Intervention Rate vs. Compliance Rate.

**Recommendation to User:**
Let's make SQ3 about **"Operational Efficiency & Compliance"**.
We will prove that the Framework is **Surgical** (High Precision), not Blunt.

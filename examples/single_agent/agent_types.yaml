  # Neutral Prompt Template (Config-Driven)
  prompt_template: |
    You are a homeowner in a city, with a strong attachment to your community. {elevation_status_text}
    Your memory includes:
    {memory}
    
    You currently {insurance_status_text} flood insurance.
    You {trust_ins_text} the insurance company. You {trust_neighbors_text} your neighbors' judgment.
    
    Using the Protection Motivation Theory, evaluate your current situation by considering the following factors:
    - Perceived Severity: How serious the consequences of flooding feel to you.
    - Perceived Vulnerability: How likely you think you are to be affected.
    - Response Efficacy: How effective you believe each action is.
    - Self-Efficacy: Your confidence in your ability to take that action.
    - Response Cost: The financial and emotional cost of the action.
    - Maladaptive Rewards: The benefit of doing nothing immediately.
    
    Now, choose one of the following actions:
    {skills}
    Note: If no flood occurred this year, since no immediate threat, most people would choose “Do Nothing.”
                                                                                                  
    Please respond using the exact format below. Do NOT include any markdown symbols:
    Threat Appraisal: [Low/Med/High] because [One sentence summary of how threatened you feel by any remaining flood risks.]
    Coping Appraisal: [Low/Med/High] because [One sentence summary of how well you think you can cope or act.]
    Final Decision: [1, 2, 3, or 4]

  # Validation Rules (PMT Coherence)

    # Rule 1: Urgency Check (Inaction Warning)
    # If Threat Appraisal is High (H), "Do Nothing" is flagged but allowed to avoid over-adaptation

      construct: TP_LABEL
      when_above: ["H"]
      blocked_skills: ["do_nothing"]
      level: WARNING

    # Rule 2: Coping-Action Alignment (Warning)
    # If Coping Appraisal is Low (L), expensive actions are flagged

      message: "Consistency Warning: Low Coping Appraisal but chose expensive action."

    # Rule 3: Relocation Anomaly (Retry Required)
    # PMT Theory: Threat Appraisal is the primary gate. If Threat is Low (L), there is no "Protection Motivation".
    # Therefore, drastic actions like Relocation are illogical regardless of Coping Appraisal (High or Low).

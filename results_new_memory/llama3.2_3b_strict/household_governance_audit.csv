Coping Appraisal: High because My house has never been severely damaged by a flood, and I don't perceive myself as particularly vulnerable to future floods.

Response Cost: The response cost of elevation is high due to its initial cost. Buy flood insurance costs relatively less upfront, but still might make me uneasy about my house's safety. Relocating would require a large amount of money, leaving my neighborhood, and other unknowns.

Maladaptive Rewards: Doing nothing means that no financial investment or effort is required this year, which can provide immediate relief from any anxiety I have about flooding, but also increases the likelihood of being exposed to future flood damage.

Coping Appraisal: Med because while I'm cautious about flood risks due to past experiences, my neighborhood has taken proactive steps towards mitigation (elevation), which reduces perceived vulnerability.

Response Efficacy: Low for all options as the cost and effort required for each option are significant. Elevating the house seems like the most effective method but is too expensive upfront. Buying insurance provides partial protection but might not be enough in severe cases.

Self-Efficacy: Med due to past experiences, I know what it's like to deal with flood damage, however, there are concerns about future risks that make me unsure of my ability to cope effectively.

Response Cost: High for Elevating the house as this option would require significant upfront expenditure. Buying flood insurance is more affordable but still poses potential financial strain in the long run. Relocating seems like the most costly option.
